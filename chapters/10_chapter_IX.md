ON Sunday, May 9th, at halfpast six in the morning, we left Skardu with 111
coolies and eight saddle-ponies — to cross the Indus and penetrate into the
Karakoram ranges. Fifteen coolies and forty-eight horses had been sent ahead the
day before.

There is a way to get from the Indus into — the Shigar valley without going
through Skardu, by crossing the Indus at Gol and following its right bank up to
the spur between the two valleys, then crossing this over a pass that leads
directly to Shigar. glance at the map will show that this route is by far the
shorter. The difficulty is that at Gol there is no means of crossing the Indus
except on small native rafts, and it would have taken the whole day to get a
party like ours across. Besides, we had too many important things to do at
Skardu to think of leaving it out.

We retraced our route of the day before to a point where the path comes down
from the alluvial terrace into the river bed. Some way up the bank above the
meeting of the Indus and the Shigar a couple of great barges were awaiting us,
upon which we embarked with baggage, coolies and ponies. Each boat was handled
by a dozen powerful oarsmen, who put the whole expedition across in half an
hour, landing on the might bank nearly opposite the starting-point, in spite of
the strong current and the breadth of the stream, which here is about 300 yards.

We mounted our ponies, and rode a couple of hours up the night bank parallel to
our course of the day before on the left, and along the foot of the spur which
separates the Indus from the Shigar valley. This spur was once the bottom of the
basin, and its upheaval at a recent period between the two valleys has forced
both rivers to bend westward before meeting. The spur slopes down into the vast
sandy delta formed by the meeting of the rivers, and ends in a descending series
of huge blocks, rising singly out of the plain. separated from each other by
stretches of the delta sand. I fancy that in tunes of exceptional flood 
the Sihgar may overflow into the Indus valley through these gaps. There are six
of these great rocks quite distinct from one another, and the last but one is
1,300 feet high. Between it and the last, which is none other than the citadel
rock of Skardu, flows the river Indus. On either side of the spur hes a vast
extent of sand drifted into clearly marked dunes, with a general trend from
north to south and the steepest slope turned to the east. They make marching
heavy for ponies and coolies. There is no trace of vegetation.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![THE PATH ON THE RIGHT BANK OF THE INDUS.](Karakoram_134.jpg "THE PATH ON THE RIGHT BANK OF THE INDUS."){#b134}
::::

In this way we covered some three miles along the bank of the Indus, and then
made for the ridge, following up a very narrow and tortuous rocky ravine, where
a few euphorbia were growing, and which, after a short ascent, led us to a wide
rounded saddle known as Strongdokmo. Here the vast Shigar valley opened before
us, stretching north-east as far as the eye could see. On both sides of the
saddle boulders have been observed which, if taken together with the polished
round-backed rocks (*ruches moutonnées*), prove that the great Shigar glacier
must have flowed over this spur. We now cut diagonally down the north siope of
the ridge, and soon reach the bottom and green cultivated land.

The map of this district shows all along the left bank of the river a series of
villages below and above Shigar. In reality there is one single belt of
cultivation several miles long, dotted with houses which are here and there
grouped around a mosque. The only group of any size is the village of Shigar.
The path is all shaded with trees, and runs between rice plantations and fields
of various crops. Between these and along the way run ditches and irrigation
canals full of yellow water, so loaded with deposit that, in order to make it
drinkable, it must first be gathered into cisterns to deposit its sediment. The
Workmans attributed to this wealth of sediment the extreme fertility of the
soil, which permits the Baltis to gather abundant harvests on the same land year
in and year out without rotation of crops. As a matter of fact, however, they
manure their fields abundantly (Moorcroft, Godwin Austen).

About two miles below Shigar the Duke was met by the Rajah with the usual
cortége and an orchestra, neither less important nor less noisy than that of
Skardu. They all escorted us to the polo ground, said to be the largest in
Baltistan, around which grow trees of exceptional size. A walnut, a poplar
(whose ancient trunk is hollowed into a huge cavity) and an immense plane remind
us of the giants we had admired in Kashmir, having, like them, all the grace of
trees which have been left to grow naturally and never mutilated by pruning.
Near the polo ground, in the shade of the chenars, stands a large mosque with
richly carved windows and doors. Inside, the columns which support the roof are
arranged round a central square, from the ceiling of which depends a hanging
lamp, The arrangement is similar to that in the Srinagar mosques, and according
to Conway is characteristic of the Shigar valley, whereas in the Indus the
centre of the mosque is usually occupied by an ornamental column.

![THE POLO GROUND AT SHIGAR.](Karakoram_136.jpg "THE POLO GROUND AT SHIGAR."){#b136}
::::

Of all the villages through which we had passed, Shigar gave us the impression
of the greatest prosperity. The increase in well-being derived from the wide
extent of the irrigated fields showed itself in the cleaner clothing of the
people and in the houses. Some of these were built of sun-baked bricks, with
verandah and roof terraces protected by a light awning of wood. Here and there
in little open places between the houses great slabs of stone are set up against
the wall and carved in rough bas-relief into concentric circles, which seem to
be targets for archery.

The people look happy, and when the grain is sown they seem to have nothing to
do but lie in the pleasant shade and wait for the crops. Nevertheless, they must
have hard and continuous work regulating the irrigation water, building and
keeping up the canals, preparing the terraced fields (which often need strong
retaining walls), removing stones and bringing large quantities of earth. At all
events, they celebrated our arrival by a cessation of all work, and the whole
population had a holiday to observe with intense interest every visible detail
of our life. They kept, however, at a respectful distance, not so much out of
fear of the slender rods of the chuprassis, which could hardly inflict much pain
through heavy woollen clothing, as owing to a natural sense of modesty and
respect.

In addition to the usual gifts of flowers, fruit and bread, they offered
numerous elaborate cakes, so adorned with white sugar that they would have done
honour to any confectioner. We were now beginning to get accustomed to the
native tea, which was frequently flavoured with rosewater, and always cleared
with a salt which precipitates the tannin and colouring substances. Among other
things they brought us cups, tumblers and pipes carved in soft green soapstone,
which is taken from a quarry in the valley behind Shigar.

Among those who came to pay their respects to the Duke we recognized a man who
had joined our escort at Tolti, whom we had confounded with the Lambardars and
chuprassis, but who now turned out to be the Wazir of Shigar. He had accompanied
the Eckenstein-Pfannl-Guillarmod expedition on the Baltoro glacier, and when he
heard of our coming he met us, wishing to join the Duke's caravan. He
accompanied the expedition throughout the campaign, and was always quiet, silent
and discreet, and of great use owing to his power over the coolies.

A young English officer back from shooting ibex and markhor^[^0900]^ encamped near us and
showed us his trophies. The afternoon was spent pleasantly in watching a lively
match of polo and in listening to the orchestra, which played for dancing. The
crowd stood, as usual, in a semi-circle behind the musicians, and here and there
from the rows of spectators peered the little heads of ponies, who seemed to
enjoy the game as much as any one. We agreed with Ujfalvy and Biddulph in
finding the Aryan type purer and more universal here than in the Indus valley.^[^0901]^
Cunningham, however, considered Mongol characteristics especially prominent
among the Baltis of Shigar. The women seemed to be kept less carefully secluded
here than in the Indus valley. One 
met them frequently about the villages, and when they are alone they expose
their faces with no great amount of backwardness. They often wore
violet-coloured clothing, and the faces of the younger ones were regular and
pleasing, and surmounted by luxuriant black hair.

Throughout the Shigar valley, and farther up in the Braldoh, I observed a number
of goitres, frequently accompanied by characteristic signs of cretinism, both
among the people and our own coolies.

The wide Shigar valley, with its level bed open on every side, makes a marked
contrast to the gloomy valley of the Indus, so deeply imprisoned between its
high and precipitous walls. It begins at the meeting of the Basha and Braldoh
valleys, whose rivers flow together and form the Shigar. Both valleys are narrow
and trough-shaped, with features common to the other valleys of the region. The
Basha valley continues in the same direction as the Shigar toward the
north-west, and gathers the waters of the numerous glaciers of the southern
slopes of the western Karakoram, which has been the scene of the frequent
expeditions of the Workmans. The Braldoh valley turns eastward and rises to the
Biafo and Baltoro glaciers.

Between its source and the point where it alters its course to wind round the
spur which divides it at the lower end from the Indus, the Shigar valley runs
from north-west to south-east for about 25 miles, maintaining a width of about
three miles and with a drop of some 350 feet.^[^0902]^ The sand has obliterated nearly
every trace of glacial action. Only in sheltered corners and on the lee side of
lateral spurs are to be found moraine remnants,^[^0903]^ which bear witness to the past
occupation of the valley up to a great height by a gigantic glacier, which
included the volumes of the Chogo Lungma, the Biafo, the Punmah and the Baltoro,
all of which glaciers even now, confined as they are to their own valleys,
inspire amazement by their vast dimensions.

Of the two mountain ranges which stand night and left of the Shigar valley, the
greater and more important is beyond doubt that to the east, which separates it
from the Braldoh valley and contains Mango Gusor (20,633 feet) and Koser Gunge
(21,000 feet)^[^0904]^ The valleys of this range are, however, so deep and so long that
only the peak of Koser Gunge is visible from Shigar, standing at the north end
of the chain and covered with great glaciers. Farther north the Shigar valley
appears to be closed by a group of snowy mountains, the Ganchen, 21,204 feet
high, which it seems the Shigar people call Simbilla. The western side of the
valley is formed by a steep range, which is all in sight from top to bottom. It
is furrowed by ravines and precipitous gorges, full of small hanging glaciers,
and dominated by a fine snow peak in the centre, the B^21^ of our maps.

:::: { .wrap-60 }
![THE SKORO LUMBA.](Karakoram_140.jpg "THE SKORO LUMBA."){#b140}
::::

The path ascends the Shigar valley on the left or western side. From Mango Gusor
runs down into the Shigar valley the first side valley, the Baumaharel, which
comes out just behind Shigar, with a mouth like a gate, only a few yards wide,
between cliffs of gneiss. Immediately beyond this opening the valley grows
wider, and is cut across by an ancient moraine. Five miles above Shigar the
second great tributary valley, the Skoro Lumba, opens out.^[^0906]^ This valley leads up
to a pass of the cham, the Skoro La, 16,716 feet high, which is the direct route
to Askoley.^[^0905]^ The journey from Shigar to Askoley is done in three stages, but at
this season the pass was still blocked with snow, and we had to go all the way
around the chain and ascend first the Shigar valley up to its bifurcation, and
then the Braldoh valley from its mouth to Askoley, more than twice the distance
but all along the valley beds.

The Shigar valley is usually taken in three stages, stopping at the villages of
Alchori and Yuno; but we did the 29 or 30 miles in two days. After Shigar, for
about six miles, we went along a shady road. unbroken even by the wide stony
beds of the torrents which flow down from the mountains on our right. Little by
little, however, increasing reaches of desert intervene between the villages,
and the cultivated land again takes the form of oases.

The Shigar river, divided into a network of rivulets, fills the whole of the
flat valley bottom, so that the path is forced to skirt the foot of the range,
whose high peaks are hidden by projecting spurs. As we approach the peak of
Koser Gunge it too disappears with its glaciers, and is no longer visible except
now and again through some valley opening. Torrents flow down from these
openings, fortunately subdivided into small streams quite easy to cross by
jumping or to ford on the ponies. We stopped for the night at Kushimul, in a
field enclosed with a little hedge, under a cherry, a pear and an apricot tree
and an old mulberry, the last festooned with a gigantic vine whose trunk had
grown almost as great as its support.

The second half of our route took us round by the projecting spur of Busper,
which runs northward from Koser Gunge, and whose ridge, running down in the
opposite direction to the Ganchen, bounds the opening of the Braldoh valley. The
mountain spurs have shoved back the path to the sand and pebbles of the valley
bottom, save for an occasional brief space where the river flows to their very
bases. Between the ends of these spurs we crossed considerable reaches of sand,
which appear to be a few hundred yards wide, and are sometimes as much as a
mile. Several tributary streams obliged us to mount our ponies
so as to ford them. The water grew thicker and muddier, as if to prepare us for
the mud streams of the Braldoh valley. It must certainly ferry down immense
quantities of clay yearly.

We now began to turn eastward little by little round Koser Gunge, and hardly
noticed that the mouth of the Braldoh valley had been entered until we found
ourselves opposite Dusso, its first village, standing on the other bank. Two
primitive native rafts, known as *zhaks*, composed of interwoven branches tied
by cords to inflated skins, were waiting for us on the bank, Each raft was
piloted by two men, and driven out into the stream with long poles as soon as we
had taken our places on the boughs, whose interstices were so large that we felt
as if we were sitting in the water. The Braldoh^[^0907]^ is at this point about 100 feet
wide and very swift. As the current caught us we began to whirl round and round,
seeing the whole of the panorama about us five or six times in the space of a
minute. A little farther downstream, at a narrow point of the river, a light
bridge had been thrown across the stream, made of two tree trunks with
cross-bars and branches laid over them; and by this route our guides and coolies
reached the opposite bank. Once on the other side, we went up as far as the
trees of Dusso and set up our camp.

We were now again shut in between steep mountain walls, and could see none of
the high peaks around us. Only westward, through the yarrow mouth of the valley,
could we catch sight of a bit of the chain to the right of the Shigar valley. A
little farther upstream two long spurs of the Koser Gunge and Ganchen run down
opposite one another, and seem quite to cut off the valley. On the ridge of the
second, just over the camp, rises the strange monolith indicated on the map by
the name of Shamasir Pir Gombar. According to the local legend, as given by
Godwin Austen, it is inhabited by a snow-white bird which guards a lump of pure
gold placed on a cushion of embroidered velvet. Any object which cannot be found
in the morning is supposed to have been stolen by the Pir. Luckily this thievish
fowl paid no attention to us.

The Tehsildar of Skardu took leave of the Duke, and retired to his home,
carrying our mails with him. The ponies had been left on the other side of the
river, and henceforward our journey was all on foot.

The Braldoh valley is of the same type as the Indus, only its smaller dimensions
make it seem even more narrow, and its walls more precipitous. It makes sharper
turns, too, round the foot of the spurs which run down on either side and cross
each other. The masses of detritus and sedimentary deposit which cling to the
precipices up to a considerable height are extremely insecure, and the path
must, without doubt, be frequently destroyed or cut off by landslides.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![THE LOWER BRALDOH, WITH THE CHONGO.](Karakoram_145.jpg "THE LOWER BRALDOH, WITH THE CHONGO."){#b145}
::::

The distance up the valley from Dusso to Askoley, the highest village, is about
22 miles, with a rise of 2,140 feet—from 7,874 to 10,013 feet. But the path is
several miles longer than the distance as the crow flies, and there must be
several thousand feet of up and down involved in crossing the numerous ridges
which lie in its way. The first and one of the very steepest is the long spur
which runs down just above Dusso, and which the path crosses about 1.000 feet
above the river. At the top of the laborious climb we halted a little to take
breath, and to gaze upon the great glaciers of Ganchen. The coolies made a
little fire in the shelter of a big projecting rock, and prepared their usual
early breakfast by crumbling their chupattis into hot water with a little salt.
Others were inhaling, turn and turn about, a few mouthfuls of smoke from the
pipes which they construct in the clay soil. A thin stick is buried in the earth
with the two bent ends projecting. Around one end they mould the earth into a
funnel-shaped pipe bowl, and then pull out the stick, leaving a little tunnel
under the earth through which they inhale through their hands. The tobacco,
which is extremely evil-smelling, will only burn when kept in contact with a
live coal. There is generally some coolie in the caravan who has brought his
primitive narghile, made out of a little gourd or hollow bit of wood, into which
are stuck the clay pipe bowl and stem, through which they smoke in turn,
grasping the end of the stem with their fist and inhaling through it. This is
also their ingenious method of smoking cigarettes. Notwithstanding their heavy
loads, they reached the top of the ridge without panting or signs of fatigue.
Those among them to whose lot the easier loads had fallen carried the flour and
provisions of their more heavily burdened companions.

Once over the top of the ridge, the path skirts down along the barren slopes
till it reaches a narrow ravine cut by the water through a terrace of detritus.
Down this we descended to the river, whose bank we then followed around the base
of high perpendicular cliffs of friable conglomerates, with notched upper edges
which represented the section of the terraces they support. Southward we could
see the whole of the Koser Gunge, with the great radiating buttresses which run
down from it; while northward, between the Ganchen and the Mushun, opens the
tributary valley of Hoh Lumba, which, with the glaciers at its head, was
explored by the Workmans in 1903. A little beyond the mouth of this valley we
set up our camp, near the village of Gomboro. Here the apricots were still in
blossom, and germination barely beginning. The sown fields were still quite
bare.

On the morning of May 13th we pursued our march up the valley, everywhere hemmed
in between steep mountain spurs coming nearer and nearer to one another and
forcing the river into a winding course. The whole valley must at one time have
been filled with immense masses of detritus mingled with clay to a height of 700
or 1,000 feet, which were then cut through by the torrent, forming extremely
steep if not absolutely vertical sections. Above the level of detritus the rock 
walls are in even more active process of disintegration than in the Indus valley.
Lydekker has observed traces of glacial action as high as nearly 2,000 feet
above the bed of the valley—vestiges of the glacier which was once formed by the
conjunction of the Baltoro, the Punmah and the Biafo.^[^0908]^ The path, which often
becomes a mere track, runs nearly the whole way along the bottom of the valley,
and is exposed to landslides, which must be common even when the weather is dry,
so frequent are the projections of the detritus wall and so ill held in place by
the loose clay. Wherever the walls looked unusually threatening we would find
ourselves unconsciously quickening our steps.

::::

We frequently came across places where the path had disappeared under streams of
mud, which had formed into fan-shape and then dried and hardened, leaving deep
indentations on the brow of the overhanging cliff. At other points, where side
ravines joined the main valley, we would go down to the bottom of deep
torrential beds covered with a thick layer of hardened mud, through the middle
of which oozed a thin trickle of muddy water. These were plainly the beds of
mudstreams. We found none in active progress, but these traces sufficed to show
the great difficulty they must present when they flow across the road many yards
wide and deep, carrying down with them heavy masses of rock. They are a
characteristic feature of all upper Baltistan, where they are known as *shwa*.
Many a traveller has been surprised by one of these moving masses—half
avalanche, half flood—and has run grave danger of seeing some of his caravan
carried off by them. All our predecessors, Godwin Austen, Conway, the Workmans
and the Eckenstein-Pfannl-Guillarmod expedition, witnessed the strange
phenomenon on a smaller or greater scale.^[^0909]^

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![THE HOH LUMBA AND THE MUSHUN GROUP.](Karakoram_148.jpg "THE HOH LUMBA AND THE MUSHUN GROUP."){#b148}
::::

The origin of the streams has never been fully explained. Very different forms
of alluvial action have, in fact, been included under the name shwa—as, tor
instance, great floods caused by the breaking of a temporary dam formed by a
landslide or by the protrusion of a lateral glacier, to which I have alluded in
my description of the Indus valley, or the sudden inundations produced by the
breaking of a glacier reservoir, These are unusual disasters, and purely casual,
as are the causes which bring them about, and they happen with the violence of
the true cataclysm. They have certainly nothing in common with the mudstreams
which may be seen every year towards the end of April^[^0910]^ oozing down the tributary
ravines of the high valleys. One strange characteristic which has been several
times observed in them is their intermittent nature. A volume of half-liquid mud
rolls down like a wave, mingled with big stones and pieces of rock of all sizes.
Then there will be an interval, long or short, of which the traveller takes
advantage to cross the bed with all speed. Then comes another great gush and
another interval, and so on. The mud gradually grows less thick, and ends by
being simply muddy water.

The volume of matter thus brought to the bottom of the valleys must be enormous,
a fact which suggested to Conway the somewhat hazardous hypothesis that to these
mud avalanches may be due the filling up of the valleys with detritus to the
depth of hundreds of yards, or even in some places absolutely up to the crests,
so as to form great table-lands such as those of Tibet and Pamir.^[^0911]^ There is no
doubt that the mud streams come from the huge banks of clay which hang upon the
walls of the valleys. These are little by little saturated with water from the
spring melting of the snows, until they reach such a point of semi-fluidity as
to slide upon the steep slopes and finally descend by their natural paths, the
gullies and ravines. Temporary obstructions caused by some great boulder and by
the viscosity of the mass itself explain the intermittency and oscillation of
the flow, which is similar to that of the lava streams on the slope of a volcano
during eruption. As I have said, we did not come across any active mud streams.
The mud in the beds was dry and hard, and looked as though it had been long
solidified, whether through an unusual delay in the melting of the snows in this
particular year or for some other reason.

We observed at frequent intervals, especially along the banks of streams,
reaches of sand covered with a white efflorescence similar to that I have
described in the Indus and Shigar valleys. ‘The oases were few and lean. The
region is poor, like the upper Dras valley. Outside of the oases the sole
vegetation consists of a few thorny thickets of roses and barberries, clumps of
wormwood with a scent between thyme and camphor, wild currant bushes and a few
gnarled junipers. Insects and lizards were still in their winter sleep. We were
nearly 10,000 feet up, and spring had hardly begun.

Presently our path was cut by a spur which ran down into the river, and we were
forced to cross to the left bank. A temporary bridge of beams supported on big
rocks projecting out of the torrent saved us from crossing on the rope bridge,
which was hanging loose and in a very dilapidated condition. A little over half
a mile farther on we returned to the right bank of the Braldoh over a solid rope
bridge, well kept up. But here, too, the coolies hastily set up a little bridge
in sections across the river, greatly facilitating the crossing of our large
party. We went up the bank as far as a wide terrace upon which stands the little
village of Chongo, where we encamped.

The valley now seemed to open out, but heavy mists rested upon the mountains,
and we scarcely caught brief glimpses of Mango Gusor, an extraordinary rocky
tooth which falls sheer to the valley, forming a huge smooth black wall cut
across by a few long straight white lines marking crevices and chimneys filled
with snow. The day was windy and cold.

A little below the village are three cemeteries, standing one above another
along the slope, so large as to seem quite out of proportion to the number of
the living, as if they had served for a much larger village than the Chongo of
to-day. Children’s graves are in the great majority mall three. In fact, the
lowest of them, through which runs the valley path, is entirely made up of the
tombs of infants. We had already noticed burying places in the Shigar valley,
entirely filled with these tiny graves, which speak volumes of the cruel process
of selection inflicted upon this people by the hard climate, their poverty and
the unhygienic conditions of their life from infancy upwards.

![CHILDREN’S GRAVES AT CHONGO.](Karakoram_151.jpg "CHILDREN’S GRAVES AT CHONGO."){#b151}
::::

In the Indus and Shigar valleys the tombs, large and small, consisted of slabs
of stone planted in the ground or of a low wall enclosing a rectangular plot.^[^0912]^
They showed no sign of being regarded with any special reverence^[^0913]^—indeed, so
little is this the case that we would find here and there one of the older and
larger graves turned into a diminutive kitchen garden. These tombs were
scattered haphazard over any open space, mostly under the trees, and not within
any enclosure. The tombs at Chongo are quite different. The low wall is replaced
by a rectangular fence of little wooden beams fitted into four square corner
posts, whose tops are cut in the shape of a die or a diamond. The most
interesting of the three cemeteries is the highest. It is now plainly abandoned,
the wall which once enclosed it partly in ruins, and of the door only the wooden
frame is left. Within this enclosure are a dozen tombs surrounded by the small
wooden railing just described and a few others, so much larger as to seem
monumental by comparison, these latter consisting of clay brick walls
strengthened at the corners by beams incorporated in the masonry. The strange
thing is that constructions so elaborate are to be found in the Indus valley
only in the most prosperous villages, whereas the habitations of Chongo are
rudely built of rough stones and mud. Upon the corners of these walled
enclosures are placed four or more big round stones. The ground within had in
several cases broken through, showing that under the enclosure the earth was
hollowed out into a chamber with a roof made of beams and beaten earth. There
was no trace of funeral objects or any fragments of skeletons.

The stage from Chongo to Askoley is only about six miles, and we had time to
stop and enjoy a warm bath in a hot spring by the way. We came across it a
little above the small torrent which supplies the Chongo oasis, on the west side
and nearly at the top of a conical hillock some 150 or 200 feet high, with a
base perhaps some 650 feet in diameter. The ground sounded hollow to the tread
or the blow of a stick, and was quite covered—possibly entirely composed—of
saline encrustations, white where new, yellowish where old. The conceal
formation is incomplete, because it is cut off on one side by the slope of the
mountain. At the top it is split by a long, deep fissure, about 18 inches wide,
through which apparently no gas issues.

The basin is perfectly round, from 50 to 60 feet in diameter and about three
feet deep in the middle—a veritable little pond, full of the most limpid water
having a slight odour of sulphurous anhydride, and an exquisite emerald hue due
to the algæ which cover the bottom. The water bubbles up through five or six
openings in two groups, one near the edge of the fountain, the other in the
centre. It overflows the furrowed lip of the basin, which is formed by
yellowish-white saline conglomerates. This formation likewise covers the whole
of one side of the cone with regular layers. The temperature of the water, taken
at the biggest opening near the edge, was 120° F. (thermometer Hicks, N.
449,310).^[^0914]^ All round this opening was a flourishing growth of long weeds. Among
them or scattered over the bottom of the basin were bundles of filaments
encrusted with calcite. Guillarmod made the interesting discovery that these
bundles are composed of hairs, but it seems improbable that they could
accumulate in such large quantities merely from the occasional falling of hair
of the natives when bathing there.^[^0915]^

From the opposite or east side of the fountain the cone slopes down In a series
of small terraces, where a stratification is occasionally visible. Many of these
terraces are fringed with a close series of small stalactites, which makes them
look like petrified cascades.^[^0916]^

After a good half-hour’s bath we started on with a lighter step, and after
crossing two more torrents reached Askoley before nine o'clock. Near the village
is an open space divided into little fields and shaded by willows and poplars.
The Duke had the camp set up in one of these fields, and the guides’ tents and
kitchen in another.

We had now reached the last inhabited spot on this side of the Karakoram.
Twenty-two days’ march had brought us 295 miles with all our luggage, without
any interruption and without a single mishap. Notwithstanding the extremely
complicated nature of the equipment and the thousands of hands it had passed
through, we had not only not lost a single piece out of over 200 packages, but
we had not even lost a single small article. What better proof could there be of
the honesty of the Baltis? We were all in splendid condition, and our
well-divided stages had brought us almost imperceptibly up to  pitch of training
for the far greater demands which were now to be made upon our strength.

![THE CARAVAN AT ASKOLEY.](Karakoram_156.jpg "THE CARAVAN AT ASKOLEY."){#b156}
::::

Askoley stands 10,013 feet above the sea level, at the very gate of the high
mountains.^[^0917]^ We had now come up out of the stuffy heat of the valleys. A little
farther on all trace of path ceases and the great frozen basins of the Karakoram
begin. We had now to change our personal equipment, put aside whatever we no
longer needed and make a thorough and careful selection of what it would pay to
take with us. Furthermore, from this point on we should have to provide for our
coolies. The grasping Kashmiri and Sikh merchants of Skardu had made us believe
that Askoley would be unable to furnish us sufficient flour, so we had bought it
all at Skardu and sent it on to Askolevy before us.

The Duke organized an advance caravan that afternoon. Ninetythree coolies
carried as many maunds (80 lbs.) of flour sewn in skins. Thirty-five more were
loaded with eases of provisions for the high regions, and ten carried the flour
which this advance party would need on the way. A huge crowd of natives from
Askoley and the lower villages assembled, hoping to be enlisted. They were of
all ages and appearances, from mere boys to feeble old men, and even some who
were crippled. For the present we engaged them as they came. Later on we would
make a careful choice of the strongest and fittest to take with us to the high
camps.

Askoley is a poor village indeed, and certainly one of the dirtiest in all
Baltistan. Numbers of the houses are empty and in ruins, as if some of the
population had abandoned the country. We were surprised to find stray dogs
about, a rare sight in a Balti village. They were as large as wolves and looked
like them, yellow and grey in colour. They wandered hungrily around the camp,
only kept off by the missiles and threats of the angry servants. Possibly they
are descendants of the dogs which Godwin Austen mentions as having been kept by
the people of Askoley for hunting and trained to drive the ibex toward the
huntsman. That was in 1861. Nowadays the natives are no longer permitted to have
firearms.

There are only a few fruit trees, but plenty of willows and poplars. The
cultivated fields are very extensive. sloping down from the village to the
river, while at a little distance above the river the mountain side is covered
with very fair pasture. The place is liable to earthquake. In 1902 the
Kekenstein-Pfannl-Guillarmod expedition felt two perceptible shocks on May 30th
and 31st.

Few communities are so cut off from the world as this little population of
Askoley. Before them lies an infinite extent of glaciers, shut in by the most
gigantic mountain ramparts in the whole world: behind them a desert valley,
which for eight months in the year is absolutely blocked by the snows, the
avalanches and the Arctic temperature. The two small panoramas here reproduced
show far better than words the appearance of the country round Askoley. They
display the utter barrenness of the slopes, the cliffs of detritus reaching half
way up the mountain walls, the cones formed by the falls of disintegrating rock,
the deep gorges hollowed out by the rivers and torrents in the thick alluvial
deposits, and the little oases of cultivation around the last three villages at
the mouth of the tributary ravines of the valley. They include, too, the fine
chain of Mango Gusor, opposite Askoley, with the valley of the Skoro La, opening
on the very face of the mountain wall at least 1,000 feet above the Braldoh; and
to the west of it a great snowy peak, whose glaciers come to a sudden end at the
top of steep couloirs, and every now and then fill the valley with the roar of
their avalanches.

In spite of these formidable natural protections, Askoley was for a long time
wasted by raids of robbers from Hunza and Nagar. These were only brought to an
end with the conquest of the latter territories by an English military
expedition and their annexation to the kingdom of Kashmir. Incredible as it may
seem, these marauding bands used to traverse the whole length of the Hispar
glacier, cross the col and descend the Biafo, more than 65 miles of ice, for the
purpose of raiding Askoley. The last raid was in 1840. A band of 700 or 800 men,
led by the Wazir Hollo, reached Askoley in the autumn, and seems to have
departed with rich booty, obtained either by violence—as Godwin Austen was told
in 1861—or according to Conway in the form of a ransom paid by the village. But
the season was too far advanced, and the whole band is supposed to have been
lost among the glaciers and snowstorms on the way back, only the leader escaping
with his life.^[^0918]^ I will speak later on of two other routes—across the
Punmah glacier and across the Baltoro—which at one time connected Askoley with
the country north of the Karakoram, Chinese Turkestan.

We had a great deal of work to get through, which kept us at Askoley for the
whole of the day following our arrival. Sella, who had worked late into the
previous night to set the photographic equipment in order, took advantage of the
halt to climb with his gun and camera on to the rock wall which overhangs
Askoley. He was rewarded by a panorama of the Mango Gusor range, a collection of
specimens of garnets and a fine *ram chikor (tetraogallus Tibetanus)*,^[^0919]^ the giant
partridge of the Himalaya. According to Thomson the people of Askoley hunt these
partridges by forming a ring around them in great numbers, and beating them from
side to side with shouts and sticks until they are so exhausted that they can be
caught with the hand. In spite of the remarkable barrenness of the slopes, big
herds of ibex and markhor, and innumerable marmots, partridges and other wild
creatures, manage to live on the scanty grass growing on the high slopes in
corners and crevices known to them only.

![GETTING SUPPLIES AT ASKOLEY.](Karakoram_159.jpg "GETTING SUPPLIES AT ASKOLEY."){#b159}

We had a little flock of sheep and goats put together to keep us supplied with
milk and meat. They were to be kept on one of the southern spurs of the Baltoro
glacier, where there would be pasturage throughout the summer months. They were
at once sent ahead with their shepherds. We carried with us also a fair number
of fowls and several dozen eggs. In this way we managed to keep supplied with
fresh provisions even on the high glaciers, and these, taken alternately with
tinned food, rendered our nourishment more palatable and less monotonous. Our
Kashmiri servants were not to accompany us any farther, but to await our return
at Askoley.

During the two days we spent at Askoley the weather was changeable, sometimes
cloudy with heavy and stagnant atmosphere, sometimes gusty with a little sleet.
The evenings were calm and clear. The temperature went down to 28° F. in the
night.

The Lambardar of Askoley, who, like his people, looked extremely wretched, took
charge of and placed in a tolerably dry and sheltered room the part of the
equipment which we had decided to leave here and the cases of provision for the
return journey to Skardu. We hoped we should not meet with the ill-luck of the
Guillarmod expedition, which was prevented from returning to Askoley by an
outbreak of cholera.
