THE Godwin Austen glacier, the two branches of it which surround to west and
east the main mass of K^2^, and the buttresses that enclose these, were surveyed
by photogrammetry. This special method, invented by the geographer Comm. Pio
Paganini, formerly an officer in the Royal Italian Navy, has been adopted by the
Military Geographical Institute of Florence for the surveying of high mountains.
Thanks to the painstaking studies of many years and to the instruments devised
and perfected by Comm. Paganini, his method has attained the highest degree of
simplicity and practical utility, and may with advantage replace all other
topographical methods in difficult or inaccessible regions. It is especially
adapted to steep mountains and large glaciers, to places beyond the frontier or
such as are occupied by the enemy; to unhealthy districts; finally, to any place
where long and tiresome marches leave little time for surveying with the plane
table, tacheometer and theodolite.

In surveying high mountainous regions with the plane table, the Military
Geographical Institute has abandoned the use of the tape. The same may be said
of the tacheometer, which under the circumstances serves as a theodolite. The
points for the survey are always determined by intersection. Then all the
directions at points useful for the survey must be observed and noted on the
spot, either with the plane table, the tacheometer or the theodolite, and
supplemented by numerous sketches to help later in making the map. The method of
the plane table, although it has the advantage of enabling one to reproduce
natural features on the spot, takes, on the other hand, more time at each
station. Moreover, in case of bad weather it is not easy to keep the drawing
from being injured in the process of execution, and finally the apparatus is
difficult to transport in the high mountains.

With the photogrammetric method all the required directions to the points may be
obtained afterwards from the photographs taken from properly chosen stations.
The photographic apparatus is provided with special measuring devices to furnish
the photographic perspectives with the elements needed for the survey. In the
field the only point of similarity between this method and earlier ones is the
determination of the stations by taking bearings to surrounding trigonometrical
points. This determination may if necessary be made at home with the panoramic
views, provided the points are well defined, as is the case in the high
mountains, where they usually consist of sharp and conspicuous summits. Thus
with the photogrammetric method all that has to be done out of doors is the
adjusting of the instrument, the taking of the panoramic views and the noting in
the field book the orientation and bearings to the trigonometrical points
necessary to determine the station. Other notes may be taken: as of the
directions which may help to determine with greater precision such distinctive
points as may be useful points of reference for subsequent stations; or to fix
the perspective when the number of trigonometric points is insufficient; or to
obtain at once a trigonometrical net connected with one or more bases measured
directly. This would be necessary in lands where no measurements had previously
been taken. The photogrammetric method consists in taking in the field a series
of views from different stations, and these pictures serve later as the basis of
all those operations which under any other method must be performed on the spot.
There is further the advantage that we can determine as many points as we want
according to the scale adopted and the amount of detail we wish to give to the
map. The Paganini apparatus supplies vertical topographical perspectives, upon
which are traced two orthogonal axes. The intersection of these axes coincides
with the principal point of the perspective, which by construction is also the
meeting of the optical axis of the lens or of the camera with the plane of the
image. Of the two perpendicular axes traced on the negative and thence
transferred to the positive, one is the line of the horizontal plane which
passes through the view-point of the perspective, and thus represents the
horizon of the station; the other is the line of the vertical plane which
contains the optical axis of the camera; hence also the view-point and the
principal point of the perspective itself. This holds good, of course, only when
the necessary adjustment of the apparatus is made previously. In order to use
the photographic perspectives thus obtained for mapping the ground which they
represent, it is necessary to know the distance of the view-point from the plane
on which they are formed—in other words, the length of the perpendicular line
drawn from the said point to this plane. As in our case we are dealing with
photographic perspectives in which the ground shown can be considered to be at
infinity,^[^2000]^ their point of view coincides with the second nodal point of the
lens, and the principal focal length of the latter represents the length of the
aforesaid distance. The lens of the Paganini apparatus is provided with a
graduated scale in millimetres and tenths of millimetres, in order that this
length may be taken with precision. It is determined once for all at the
beginning of work, by bringing into the focal plane distant points and making a
series of observations in order to arrive at a mean value approximating the true
one. With the help of the graduated scale it is easy to keep this value constant
in all the perspectives obtained during the survey. Paganini calls this value
the “indicated focal length,” to distinguish it from the one determined
afterwards at home for the perspectives on paper, which serve for the actual
construction of the map. For further particulars the reader is referred to the
hand-book mentioned above. This factor is most important because it establishes
the relation between the dimensions of the objects and those of the
corresponding images on the perspectives. It must be determined therefore with
the greatest care and, when necessary, corrected by calculations before setting
to work on the survey.

Another element which must be established upon the spot is the orientation of
the perspective: that is, the horizontal angle made by the optical axis of the
camera (in other words, the perpendicular line from the view-point to the
perspective) with the direction to a previously determined point in the field of
operations; or, failing this, the azimuth of the optical axis, given by a
compass attached to the apparatus. The outdoor work, therefore, is reduced to
the following steps: (1) The adjustment of the instrument; (2) the rectification
of the level or of the verticality of the axis of rotation; (3) the execution of
the panorama (preferably in the first perspective intersecting with the vertical
wire some signal point or conspicuous point previously fixed, in order to
orientate the panorama with as great precision as possible), and (4) the
observations of zenith and azimuth—or of the latter alone, as in the case of the
apparatus used by the expedition of the surrounding trigonometrical points
necessary to fix the position of the station, with the addition at most of
certain conspicuous points which may later be of value as reference points for
locating other stations in cases where geodetic points are unavailable.

#### II.— Description of the Apparatus.

PAGANINI has invented various types of photogrammetric apparatus for the use of
the Italian Military Geographical Institute. They are manufactured by the
Galileo Company, of Florence. However, when the expedition wished to furnish
itself with an instrument, this firm had only one on hand, a model of 1897,
arranged by Comm. Paganini for surveys on the scale of 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 in
Erithrea. This model, however, though less in weight, bulk and price, and
possessing the greatest simplicity and ease of manipulation, is not altogether
adapted for work in very high mountains. We had to content ourselves with it,
none the less, as the time was too short for the construction of a new
instrument. Paganini has recently invented a marvellously ingenious one, which
unites all the advantages I have mentioned with that of the higher degree of
precision possessed by the model furnished with the vertical circle, which was
an earlier invention.

The pattern of 1897 has a short focal length (18 centimetres) and takes plates
18 by 24 centimetres (7 by 9½ inches), with the larger side horizontal in order
to take in the entire horizon with an equipment of six plates. It may be
employed successfully in Erithrea, and has given brilliant results in Russian
work in Transbaikalia and Transcaucasia, where the district is less rough and
the differences of level less pronounced than in the Alps and the Himalaya. But
in the photogrammetric work executed on the Baltoro and Godwin Austen glaciers
the panoramic views could not all include the highest peaks, as was, of course,
desirable, because the vertical dimension of the plates was too limited to
embrace the enormous difference of height between the stations and the
surrounding summits. Moreover, the instrument was not furnished with the
vertical circle and telescope, as in the other Paganini models; thus the
bearings to the most important points had to be taken by means of the vertical
wire as seen through the ground glass, and others, as also the heights of the
points, had to be determined at home by the co-ordinates z and y of their images
measured on the perspectives. These facts simplified the outdoor work very much,
but increased the labour afterwards in obtaining the data for the construction
of the map. Undoubtedly this apparatus enables the work to be done very quickly
on the mountains, and reduces to a minimum the time spent by the operator while
exposed to discomfort and bad weather. He must note the indispensable data.
These are recorded in a field book, together with such subsidiary observations
as sketches to facilitate the locating of the points in the panoramas, names,
routes followed, time of exposure and other miscellaneous information. The
apparatus has also the great advantage of maintaining unaltered for a long time
the adjustments made before beginning work—a fact which contributes much to the
success of the observations. A brief description of the apparatus will make this
plainer.

It consists of a rigid camera, made of aluminium, in form a right prism, the
base of which is an isosceles trapezium. The back of the camera, which is
perpendicularly placed upon the largest of the parallel sides of the trapezium,
consists of a frame holding the ground glass or the sensitive plate. The front
of the camera has fixed at its centre a tube, inside which runs another tube
adjustable by means of a screw with a millimetre thread. To this the lens is
fixed. A graduated scale in millimetres, which has as origin the focal
plane—that is the surface upon which the images are received—is marked
externally along the fixed tube, while to the movable tube carrying the lens is
attached a ring with a sharp edge which comes into contact with the fixed tube.
Thus, turning the inner tube in order to move the lens backward and forward
causes the edge of the ring to cut the graduated scale, and thus serves as
fiducial line or line of collimation, indicating on the scale itself the
distance of the lens from the focal plane. The bevelled edge of the ring is
divided into ten equal parts in order to read upon it the divisions of the
movable tube—in other words, the tenths of the thread of the screw. This, added
to the whole number of millimetres read on the fixed tube, gives in millimetres
and tenths of millimetres the distance of the second nodal point of the lens
from the focal plane. This value, the "principal mndicated focal length,” is
determined at the beginning of the campaign, and in all subsequent operations
care must be taken that the line of collimation of the tube carrying the lens is
so adjusted as to give always the same value. This was carefully determined upon
the apparatus of the expedition before leaving Srinagar, and gave a result of
180.3 millimetres.

![PAGANINI PHOTOGRAMMETRIC APPARATUS, 1897 MODEL.](Karakoram_379.jpg "PAGANINI PHOTOGRAMMETRIC APPARATUS, 1897 MODEL."){#b379}
::::

The objective is a Zeiss anastigmatic and belongs to a special series of wide
angulars for photogrammetric work. With a small diaphragm we obtain a clear
image 40 centimetres in diameter; with the f-35 diaphragm it produces a clear
image free from distortions upon a plate of 20 by 26 centimetres. Thus the plate
18 by 24 centimetres used with this camera took very clear images over its
entire surface, even when a large aperture diaphragm was employed; while the
luminosity is so great that it is better to use plates of only medium rapidity,
or, better still, orthochromatic ones, as we did. The perspectives thus obtained
have a horizontal field of 67° and a vertical one of 54°. In this way, with six
perspectives with a displacement of the optical axis of the camera about the
vertical axis of the apparatus of 60° for each of them, a panorama is obtained
which comprises the whole horizon, plus a narrow vertical band—a horizontal
field of 3° 30´ between each one and the next. This vertical band in excess is
indispensable, to ascertain the correctness of the panorama, to determine the
distance of the point of view from the perspectives, and to join the positives
accurately to one another in order to form the panorama. As the vertical field
is 54°, one can measure from the perspectives and vertical angles up to 27°.
Owing to the enormous differences in level with which the expedition had to
contend, a larger vertical field would have been more advantageous. In the new
apparatus of Comm. Paganini it is possible to adjust the camera so as to have
the larger dimension of the plate (24 cm.) run vertically, giving angles of
height or depression up to 33° 30´. To make the entire circle of the horizon
eight plates would be necessary, with a horizontal displacement of 45° of the
optical axis, giving a vertical band of 4° 30´ between each two contiguous
pictures. The new instrument, being capable of reduction to telescope and being
furnished with the vertical circle, can, even without the reversible movement I
have described, take the angle of peaks whose summits fall outside the upper
margin of the plate. This arrangement, too, would have been very useful in the
construction of the map.

In all the Paganini apparatus the optic axis of the lens is fixed in a direction
perpendicular to the plane of the image. The intersection of the above axis with
this plane is marked photographically by the intersection at right angles of two
very thin silver hairs stretched before the ground glass on the back of the
camera in such a way that they can be easily withdrawn or replaced in case of
breakage. The horizontal silver hair, once adjusted, serves, as I have said, to
indicate the horizon line upon the photographic perspective. Below the camera
are three arms bent at right angles, one anterior and the others posterior. Each
has a hole in its end, through which passes an adjustable shaft fixed
perpendicularly to the movable plate or alidad of the horizontal circle. The
camera can be fixed rigidly at the required position upon the alidad by means of
nuts and bolts screwed on to the shafts. This position remains, if possible,
invariable throughout all the outdoor work. Its stability is very important,
since the said position must satisfy the requirement that the plane containing
the optic axis of the camera and the axis indicating the horizon of the station
is exactly horizontal as soon as the rotation-axis of the alidad or of the
instrument has been vertically disposed. Thus the only adjustment to be made of
the instrument in the different stations is to correct the level placed on the
alidad, at the same time arranging vertically the rotation-axis of the
apparatus.

The azimuthal circle of the apparatus has a diameter of 14 centimetres and its
edge is graduated from 0° to 360°, each degree being subdivided into two equal
parts, each of which embraces 30’. The vernier is fastened to the movable plate
or alidad, and permits us to read the minutes and to appreciate even the 30´. In
addition to the three shafts and a level, the alidad is provided with a
magnifying lens to use with the vernier and a regulating-screw to use for the
small adjustments of colimation. The verticality of the rotation-axis of the
instrument is attained by means of three levelling-screws, which pass through
the top of the tripod and hold the horizontal circle. This is fixed upon the
tripod by means of a clamping-screw with a spring and a handle, which, passing
through the head of the tripod from bottom to top, is screwed into a movable
support shaped like a half-sphere, fastened by means of a ring under the
horizontal circle.

A compass of the Dixey or the Smalcalder type is mounted upon the top of the
camera. It can be so adjusted that the vertical visual plane of its bearings
coincides with the direction of the optic axis of the camera. Thus it becomes
possible to use the compass to orientate the panorama when it is not possible to
aim at trigonometric points or at any others of which the position is known. The
tripod may be taken to pieces; each foot is in two parts^[^2001]^ which can be solidly
fastened together when the apparatus is set up. We have seen that the most
important adjustment consists in fixing the camera upon the alidad in such a way
that the plane containing the optical axis and the silver hair which traces the
horizon-line upon the perspectives are perpendicular to the rotation-axis of the
instrument, and reciprocally, when this rotation-axis is adjusted vertically
the plane of the optical axis will be horizontal. In the other apparatus of
Paganini this result is attained by means of the telescope of the acclimeter,
which may be inverted (pattern 1884), or by the same camera obscura reduced to a
reversible telescope (pattern 1889). In the model employed by the expedition the
horizontal adjustment is made as follows:—

The three arms of the camera are first placed at approximately the same height
upon the movable plate by turning the lower screws with the pins belonging to
them, having previously raised the upper ones in order to give free motion to the
arms on their respective shafts. Then looking through the ground glass of the
camera under the black cloth, and moving to right or left and up or down as
necessary, by adjusting the screws, distant points are brought to coincide with
the point of intersection of the wires, until by moving the camera in both
directions around the rotation-axis, a point is made to run all along the
horizontal thread from one extreme to another, without passing above or under
the thread. If the rotation-axis is vertical, this coincidence of a point with
the horizontal thread in its whole length can only take place when the plane of
the optical axis and the wire which traces the horizon-line on the perspective
are horizontal. If the plane is not horizontal, and accordingly the plane of the
ground glass is not vertical, one observes that in moving the camera to right or
left the image gradually diverges from the horizontal wire, describing the
segment of a hyperbola either above or below the wire, according as the point
cited is situated above or below the horizon.

In practice the following method will secure the horizontal adjustment of the
wire and the plane of the optical axis:—

First turn the screws which support the posterior arms of the camera, operating
in such a way that by revolving the camera all the way through its field some
distant point which is covered by the wire on one of its ends coincides with the
other end of the wire. Thus the horizontality of the wire will be fixed. If this
point is not on the horizon, it will be seen to describe a curve during the
revolving of the camera, passing above or below the intersection of the wires
according to the inclination of the optic axis downwards or upwards. The vertex
of the hyperbola will be found upon the vertical thread, and it will be easy to
estimate the convexity of the said curve. Then the screw controlling the
anterior arm of the camera will be turned, and the latter raised or lowered
until the image of the point is brought to coincide with the intersection of the
wires. By making observations of successive points continually approaching the
horizon, the right position will soon be arrived at, when all the screws are
tightened in order rigidly to maintain it.

#### III.—Calculations and Construction of the Map.

TRUE panoramic view obtained under the above conditions gives an image of all the
field seen from the station. Together with other panoramic views obtained in
like manner at suitable stations, it gives the elements necessary for the
execution, on any scale, of the map of that tract of land which they represent.
Each perspective of the series is considered separately in constructing the map.
The focal distance is equal for all, and all are furnished with the horizon-line
and the line of the vertical plane, the latter containing the visual point and
the principal point of the perspectives.

Paper positives are used for making the survey, it being possible to allow for
the alteration undergone by one single quality of paper and to use a focal
length corrected accordingly. This focal length is obtained before proceeding to
the survey. It is independent of the “indicated focal length,” and is called the
“real focal length.” All the directions to the points represented in each
picture may be easily determined by means of the co-ordinates *x* and *y* of their
images referred to the perpendicular axes traced on the picture itself, through
the following very simple equations:

:::: { .wrap-30 .align-center  }
![(1)](Karakoram_382a.jpg ""){#b382a}
::::

where *f* is the real distance of the view-point from the perspective, the
orientation of which ω’ is known, being an element obtained at the station, and
ω’  is the angle made by the horizontal direction to a point (x, y) of the
perspective with the perpendicular to it from the view-point.

:::: { .wrap-40 .align-center  }
![(2)](Karakoram_382b.jpg ""){#b382b}
::::

where α is the angle that the direction to the image of the point observed
makes with its projection upon the horizon, that is to say, with the horizontal
direction of the point itself. But also it is

:::: { .wrap-30 .align-center  }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_382c.jpg ""){#b382c}
::::

where L is the difference of level between the point considered and the station and
D the horizontal distance between these points. Hence

:::: { .wrap-30 .align-center  }
![(3)](Karakoram_382d.jpg ""){#b382d}
::::

After having obtained by formula (1) the bearings of the various points useful
for the survey, which are visible on the panoramic views taken from two or more
stations, the position of these may be obtained by intersection.

By formula (2) we get their angular elevation; then, having the distance and the
difference of level between the points and the station, by means of tables in
use at the Military Geographical Institute, one can finally obtain directly the
vertical difference by means of formula (3).

But this is a very long method, and in order to solve the equations given above
it is necessary to have the numerical value of the co-ordinates *x* and *y* and
the distance. These numerical values are very useful when the survey is on a
very large scale, as in civil or military operations; whenever it is a question
of data for finding points on the ground. But they are superfluous for a
topographical map on a small scale, as in the construction of the map these
values would have in any case to be reproduced graphically.

#### IV.—Simplifying the Survey by means of Special Drafting Instruments.

BY the Paganin photogrammetric method adopted by our Military Geographical
Institute, the position of the points and their elevation can be taken
mechanically and rapidly by means of special drafting instruments, the
construction of which is based upon the above formula, and upon which the
distance *D* and the coordinates *x* and *y* are transferred directly with the
compass and upon the scale of the map, making it unnecessary to know the
numerical value of these measurements.

The construction proceeds in the following manner: the trigonometric points are
fixed at the desired scale by means of their rectilinear co-ordinates. Then with
the special instrument called by Paganini “*rapportatore ad origine variabile,*”
the photogrammetric stations are put in place, as well as whatever other special
points have been selected for the purpose of adding to the points of reference
in a number proportionate to the scale of the survey. With this instrument the
various directions can be traced directly on the transparent paper just as they
were read at the time of the outdoor operation on the horizontal circle of the
photogrammetric apparatus or the theodolite. With the transparency thus made are
placed the stations and the directions from them to the other images necessary
to determine further points of reference in addition to the trigonometric ones.
With this instrument it is possible to assume any one of the bearings observed
as origin of the horizontal circuit and to proceed by degrees, by means of the
alidad, to the other readings. In this way is obviated the necessity of all the
mathematical calculations to reduce to zero the readings made out of doors, as
is the case when the ordinary finders are used—a very long operation when there
is a large number of points to be located.

When the stations and all the points intersected by them have been put on paper,
we proceed to the determination of the secondary points, or detail, all chosen
beforehand for the purpose of the draft. After the various elements of the
panoramic views have been corrected, a selection is made from them (taking them
two by two, at contiguous stations) of points useful to the survey; either for
the purpose of tracing contours, or for determining the lie of various ridges,
the direction of streams, the limits of glaciers, bases of rocks, &c. The
operation is regulated for the number of points chosen according to the scale
that is desired, the precision required, and the time at the disposition of the
operator. All these points have been registered in the notebook, according to
the station from which they were taken, and marked on the relative panoramic
views with numbers or letters written in red ink.

:::: { .wrap-80  }
![PAGANINI DRAFTING INSTRUMENTS USED IN CONSTRUCTING THE MAP.](Karakoram_384.jpg "PAGANINI DRAFTING INSTRUMENTS USED IN CONSTRUCTING THE MAP."){#b384}
::::

The tracing on the design of all directions to these secondary points used to be
a very long and monotonous operation and far from accurate. The modern process
is quick and simple, thanks to a special drafting instrument based upon the
formula (1) quoted above, and called the '"graphical sector for the directions
to secondary points of the perspective.” By its means the horizontal projection
of each perspective is traced successively upon the design, carefully
orientated, with its principal point at the effective distance from the station
point, in such a way that, by transferring with the compass the abscissa of the
various points taken on the views to a scale cut on a metal ruler, the
corresponding horizontal directions may be easily drawn by means of 2 movable
plate (or alidad) furnished with a metal ruler, moving about the station point.

With another instrument, specially designed for drawing the elevations, based
upon formula (2) and (3), differences of level are obtainable, and therefore
also the elevations of the stations and of the secondary points of the
retrospectives. When the apparatus is provided with vertical circle and
telescope the angular elevations of the trigonometrical points are read directly
on the ground. In this case one obtains the elevation directly from reading the
instrument, by means of the distance on the design between the station point and
the trigonometrical point of which the altitude is known and from the station
point to the observed angle α.

But without the vertical circle the determination of the heights depends upon
the value of the abscissa and the ordinates of the trigonometric points of the
perspectives, the height of which is taken with the compass on the perspectives
themselves, likewise their graphic distances; so that the differences of level
between them and the station point, and also the height of the latter, may be
read directly upon the instrument. In the same manner, once the height of the
stations is obtained, the difference of level is determined, and therefore the
height of the secondary points of the perspective considered useful to complete
the survey. As in the case of all the other methods, corrections must, of
course, be made of all these apparent differences of level, on account of the
refraction of the light and the roundness of the earth. Tables compiled for the
purpose are used.

#### V.—Topographical Work of the Expedition and Construction of the Survey.

IN a little more than a month—in other words, from May 25th to July 2nd—the
expedition executed twenty-two photogrammetric stations, using 106 negatives. On
account of the limited number of plates at our disposal, not all the panoramic
views embraced the entire horizon. The region surveyed includes the Concordia
amphitheatre of the Baltoro glaeier, the Godwin Austen ¢lacier up to Windy Gap
and the Savoia glacier, which flows about the western side of K^2^.^[^2002]^ It was a
pity that lack of plates prevented our extending the survey southward, upon the
arm of the Baltoro as far as Bride Peak, the ascent of which was one of the aims
of the expedition. The work was supplemented, it is true, by compass and
tacheometer and with barometrical stations; but among the inumerable peaks of
such strange appearance the eye becomes easily confused in passing from one
station to another. The numerous sketches taken on the spot did not give all the
information really desirable for map-drawing, and are certainly inadequate to
give all the characteristic detail of this rugged, broken and largely
inaccessible region. Sella’s numerous photographs and panoramic views were, on
the other hand, of great assistance in making the design, as some of them were
taken from high and commanding elevations and under conditions making it
possible to determine approximately the photogrammetric elements, so that they
served,if not for measurements of altitude, at least for sufficiently exact
azimuthal directions. With this end in view, Sella marked his stations by
setting up cairns visible from the photogrammetric stations, so that they could
be included in the network of stations of reference or geodetic points upon
which the survey was based.

It is possible that instead of glass plates we might have used films, which are
so much more convenient because of their small bulk and weight. Comm. Paganini,
however, does not consider their use advisable, as no good results have been
obtained with them in three previous campaigns. They easily undergo changes in
the celluloid, owing to their sensitiveness to heat, cold, moisture and the
chemicals used in developing; so that the image varies in a way which would not
be noticeable in ordinary photographic work, but which is sufficient to cause
errors in the measurements, which must be corrected to the tenth and hundredth
of a millimetre.

The Military Geographical Institute was authorized to execute the topographical
representation of the region surveyed by the expedition. It confided the work to
Comm. Pio Paganini. The scale chosen for the map was 1:100,000. The work proved
somewhat arduous, especially at the beginning, on account of the deficiency of
well-defined geodetic points, which necessitated referring the survey to several
conspicuous points determined by intersection—in other words, concluded from
vertices of the secondary triangulation executed for Kashmir, which is, in its
turn, connected with the North-western Himalayan series of the primary
triangulation of India. A double chain of triangles (quadrilateral and diagonal)
of the secondary triangulation of Kashmir extends along the course of the Indus
from south-east to north-west, from a point very near its sources to as far as
Skardu, where it bends southwards in order to join up with the main system of
the Indian survey. From the vertices of this portion of the trigonometric chain
(Upper Indus triangulation) were intersected the highest summits of the
Karakoram, including the two Masherbrums, Peak No. 8 or Bride Peak, Peak No. 9
or Hidden Peak, Nos. 10, 11 and 12 of the Gasherbrum range, and lastly and
highest of all Peak No. 13 or K^2^—all these summits surrounding the tract which
was to be mapped. But we must consider that these points were intersected at
distances of 50 and 100 miles with cross-bearings meeting at acute angles and
taken from relatively low points, while there were no signal stations to mark
with precision the points aimed at, and thus it was not possible to determine
their position otherwise than approximately. However, the following table shows
the elements of the points which were used for the purpose in question. It was
not always easy to recognize them as they appeared on the perspectives. They
were measured also with the tacheometer from several stations, as is shown on
the sketch of the triangulation.

We see that the figures most to be trusted are those for Masherbrum East; the
other Peak, or South-east, was omitted because it was invisible from the region
surveyed, being masked by the first, which is only about 1,000 feet from it. The
tract surveyed was comprised within a square formed by Masherbrum, Bride Peak,
Hidden Peak and K^2^. Thus a point was chosen for the origin of the rectilinear
co-ordinates which was the approximate centre of this square—that is to say,
about at the intersection of the meridian 76° 35´ E. with the parallel 35° 45´.
The graduation of the longitude in the final survey was put 2° 30´ farther east,
according to the correction made in 1877 to the longitude of Madras, upon which
are based the longitudes of the triangulation of India.

The most distant point, Masherbrum, is about 15 miles from the origin of the
co-ordinates; as the origin itself has the latitude of 35° 45", nearly the same
as the southern end of Italy, the elements for the calculation of the
rectilinear co-ordinates are already to be found in the appropriate tables.^[^2003]^
They result from the formulae:

:::: { .wrap-50 .align-center  }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_387a.jpg ""){#b387a}
::::

in which *L* is the latitude and *P* the longitude of the point; *I~0~*, *II~0~*,
and *III~0~*, are constants which depend upon the origin of the co-ordinates of
latitude *L* and longitude *P*. The value of these constants is obtained from
the aforesaid tables and calculated with the Bessel ellipsoid elements:

:::: { .wrap-50 .align-center  }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_387b.jpg ""){#b387b}
::::

*N* and *p* are respectively the great normal and the radius of curvature of the
meridian ellipsis for latitude *L*. For the points before mentioned, with the
relative geographical co-ordinates given by the catalogue contained in Vol. VII
(Division E, Group I, No. 13), Triangulation of Kashmir, the following
rectilinear co-ordinates were obtained :—

:::: { .wrap-100 }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_387c.jpg ""){#b387c}
::::

Thus it was possible to fix the above points on the drawing on the scale of
1:100,000, proceeding afterwards to the necessary adjusting by means of the
sides, using the well-known formula:

:::: { .wrap-40 .align-center  }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_388a.jpg ""){#b388a}
::::

where the angle ϕ is given by the formula:

:::: { .wrap-40 .align-center  }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_388b.jpg ""){#b388b}
::::

This formula may also be used for distances over 30 miles. *S* is the length or
side unknown: *L~0~&nbsp;=&nbsp;L~m~&nbsp;+&nbsp;ϵ* where *L~m~*, is the mean latitude and *ϵ* a
little correction omitted in case of distances under 25 miles. *N~0~* and *ρ~0~*
are the principal radii of the ellipsoid, in correspondence with latitude
*L~0~*. Thus were obtained the following distances:—

:::: { .wrap-100 }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_388c.jpg ""){#b388c}
::::

The circuits of the horizon, executed from different stations and transferred to
the drawing by means of the finder, serve also to fix on the design the
photogrammetric and tacheometric stations, and also to determine those other
significant points which are to be used as points of reference for further
stations and for the orientation of the perspectives. This was indispensable,
for the photogrammetric stations scattered over the Savoia and Godwin Austen
glaciers, not all of which could take in three points of the Indian
Triangulation, could by this means be located with sufficient exactness on the
drawing.^[^2004]^

Two positives were printed of each of the panoramic views, one for composing the
panoramas themselves, the other to measure with the compasses the coordinates of
the points useful in the survey, after having chosen and distinguished them on
the views. The effective distance of the perspective view-point was then
determined on the unmounted prints. All these being taken under the same
conditions and with a constant indicated focal length, and the same quality of
paper being used for printing, always cut the same way of the fibre, the result
must be a constant value for the effective distance, in all the printed
positives. This value is determined by getting the mean of various measurements
made on several perspectives and for different panoramas^[^2005]^. The focal length
indicated by the lens in our case was 180.3 millimetres. and the true focal
length determined at Florence was 180.6 millimetres. After having chosen and
marked in red on the perspectives the various secondary points to be mapped, and
transferred their absciss upon the sector in accordance with the directions
already described, and properly orientated on the drawing, the directions to the
said points of the various stations are traced, and by intersection their
position in the survey is obtained. Some 300 points were determined in this way.

Finally, in the same way, by carrying the abscissa and ordinates upon the finder
for altitudes the heights of the said points were determined by at least two
derivations. With the help of all these points and the stations and references
fixed upon the panoramas, it was possible to complete the map, inserting the
details and forms of the region—in which the panoramas were of the greatest
assistance.

The difficulty of the ground, the scarcity of trigonometric joints, the
impossibility—owing to the enormous differences of level—of accurately sighting
trigonometric summits unprovided with signals, the short time at our disposal,
the limited number of photographic plates, all this prevented us from gathering
sufficient elements for a true topographical survey. However, we may feel some
satisfaction over the result achieved under such conditions. It has at all
events sufficient accuracy to serve as point of departure for other explorers
making a more extended survey in the same field.

In conclusion, I must express our gratitude to Comm. Paganini, to whose methods
and whose instruments we are almost wholly indebted for the work executed on the
spot, and to whose experience and assistance we owe the execution of the map. My
zeal to make known an admirable topographical method, remarkable for its
simplicity and its suitability for high mountain work, has led me to describe it
in considerable detail. For, despite the fact that this method has been employed
in Italy, with the best results, since 1876, and has been introduced also in
certain foreign countries, the English Royal Geographical Society does not
mention it, even in its most recent publications (*Hints to Travellers,* 9th
ed., 1906, and *Maps and Map Making*, E. A. REEVES, 1910), and, in fact,
considers the application of photography to topography to have a very limited
and subordinate value. The June number of the *Geog. Jour.,* 1911, has an
article by A. O. WHEELER, of the Topographical Office of the Canadian
Government, in which full justice is rendered to the photogrammetric method, and
which will no doubt contribute toward making it better known in England.

### I.—LIST OF INSTRUMENTS USED.

:::: { .wrap-40 .float-left  }
![&nbsp;&nbsp;](Karakoram_394.jpg ""){#b394}
::::

THE expedition was equipped with the following instruments for making the more
important meteorological observations, especially those used for computing
heights:—

I.  One mercurial Fortin barometer, No. 3314, with graduated scale from 240 to
520 millimetres. Id. No. 3313, with graduated scale from 240 to 520 millimetres.
Id. No. 3312, with graduated scale from 210 to 490 millimetres. Id. No. 1, with
graduated scale from 200 to 400 millimetres.
II.  Two aneroid barometers furnished with three graduated scales for altitudes
to 29,000 feet. 
III.  One hypsometer with three pairs of thermometers:—
      * 1st from 58° to 78° in tenths.
      * 2nd from  65° to  88°  in tenths.
      * 3rd  from 72° to 102° in half-tenths.
IV.  Two pairs of thermometers maximum and minimum self-registering.
V.  Four mercurial thermometers.
VI.  Two standard thermometers.
VII.  Four thermometers with bulb blackened in vacuum. 

All the above instruments were verified at the National Physical Laboratory at
Kew, with the exception of the hypsometers. Of these the pair from 72° to 102°
had already been used on the Ruwenzori expedition, and the others were
manufactured and corrected in Geneva. 

The correction of some of the mercurial Fortin barometers remained uncertain for
lack of apparatus with which to compare them at such unusually low pressures;
but this was compensated for by making numerous comparisons under low pressures
in the mountains. In this way it was possible to use all the barometers.

These instruments, in consequence of their special construction, are very
fragile, and unfortunately the damage is not easily discovered by external
marks, so that the observations may be very erroneous if not taken with great
caution. It is necessary for this reason to submit them to continual comparison
in order to give assurance of their regular working. A great many of these
comparisons were made both with the barometers and the hypsometers—in fact every
time the opportunity arose—and always with reference to No. 3314, of which the
exact correction was known. Especial care was taken to preserve this barometer
from deterioration.

In order to render the following table more concise, only those results are
given which were obtained from the various series of comparisons, some of which
were made before the highest ascents, some at the most elevated points and some
during the descent.

:::: { .wrap-100 }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_394a.jpg ""){#b394a}
::::

The table shows that despite the difficulty of transportation, the
correspondence of the barometers was very satisfactory, so that the results
obtained are quite reliable. It is important to note that the greatest number of
observations were taken with barometers Nos. 3314 and 3313 (No. 3312 was used in
the base camp at Rdokass), and that the observations with the hypsometer were
always taken at the same time (with two, and sometimes with four thermometers)
to avoid all chance of error. The readings of the thermometers (within the
limits of approximation of the instrument) were always in accordance with those
of the barometers.

Only limited use was made of the aneroids. However, they were compared from time
to time with the mercurial Fortin barometers in order to keep them ready in case
of need. The experience acquired in Africa on the Ruwenzori, as well as on the
present expedition, has positively demonstrated that one cannot rely upon the
indications given by the aneroid barometers, however accurate their
construction, on account of the unavoidable shaking up they get in
transportation. The hypsometer was carried as a substitute for the mercurial
barometers in case of breakage, and also for those ascents on which it might not
be possible to carry the barometers. The hypsometer certainly gives a less
degree of precision than the mercurial barometer. The error of one-tenth of a
degree (which is not unlikely to occur owing to the difficulties attending the
observations) would cause a corresponding error in the pressure of about two
millimetres, an error not possible to the readings of the mercurial barometer.

To ensure the greatest possible degree of accuracy, the use of the hypsometer
was constantly associated with that of the mercurial barometers; because, though
no doubt the results it gives have a smaller degree of precision, it may be
useful in detecting the presence of any disturbing agent in the Fortin
barometers—the penetration of an air bubble, for instance, which is the
commonest and the most to be feared. With few exceptions, use was made of the
sling-thermometers for measuring the temperature of the air. These are certainly
preferable to the stable ones, although long usage proved fatal to several of
the instruments. They enabled us to obtain the measurement of the tension of
vapour and of the humidity of the air, their bulbs being covered with a sheath
of cotton soaked in water.

In order to get an approximate idea of the intensity of the sun’s heat,
thermometers with the bulb blackened in vacuum were used.

In providing the above instruments, the Duke was perfectly aware of the just
criticism usually made by scientists upon determinations of this nature. But he
contented himself with little, not being able to obtain the best.^[^2006]^

The carrying of a meteorological cage would have been difficult, and its
advantage was problematical. Therefore the following arrangement was adopted for
the exposure and reading of the instruments.

At Rdokass, where the period of the observations was most extended, the
instruments were hung on a cross-piece about three feet high, held up by two
stakes, while a waterproof cap of convenient height served to protect them from
rain and sun at every hour of the day. For the other stations a wooden tripod
was employed, covered with a strong canvas cap, under which the instruments were
suspended in such a manner as to secure free circulation of air.

The hours of observations indicated in the following tables correspond always to
the local time at which the observations were taken in the observatories of
India, the data of which were considered as terms of comparison.

The greatest accuracy was aimed at in taking the observations—as far as the
sometimes very difficult circumstances would permit. The comparison of
barometers, which I have described above—which might satisfy the requirements of
a laboratory rather than the conditions of an arduous campaign—is sufficient
demonstration of the care and circumspection practised. In the tables that
follow are given all the observations taken by the expedition from Gund to
Tragbal, between April 25th and August 8th.

The readings of the barometers have been corrected for instrumental error,
reduced to 0°, and for gravitation; corresponding corrections for all the other
readings being made in the same way.

The tables showing the observations as they were entered in the note-book on the
spot, though they refer to only a limited period of time, form a valuable and
interesting addition to our knowledge of the climatology of these distant and
still little known regions.

### II.—TABLE OF RESULTS.

### III.—ALTIMETRIC CALCULATIONS.

BESIDE the results obtained by his own observations, which are given in the
preceding pages, the Duke gathered a very large harvest of data from the
meteorological observatories of India, in order to get the terms of reference
required for the calculation of the altitudes. As results from the above data, a
first base station was fixed at Rdokass, at an altitude of about 13,000 feet,
well up on the Baltoro glacier, on which were taken observations of pressure,
temperature and humidity for a period lasting from May 29th to July 15th.

Afterwards a second base was fixed at an altitude of about 16,000 feet (Camp
III) at the very foot of K^2^, beside other secondary ones, in order to secure
nearer points of reference for the calculation of the height of the points
reached in the various ascents. These calculations were made on the following
basis:—

For all the stations before Rdokass and for those from Bride Peak onward the
calculation of the various heights was made by comparing them with the
simultaneous readings taken at the stations of Leh, Skardu, Gilgit, and in some
cases with those taken at Srinagar as well. All observations taken at stations
higher than Rdokass (from May 29th to July 15th), which formed the principal
objects of the expedition, were compared with those taken simultaneously at
Rdokass, except for the two last, after July 15th, when owing to a
misunderstanding the observations at Rdokass were discontinued.

For the station near Bride Peak, which was the highest point reached, comparison
was made with the readings taken at the four stations of Leh, Srinagar, Skardu
and Gilgit.

Of the results given in the foregoing pages, those were especially taken into
consideration for which the simultaneous data of reference were secured, these
being complete (that is to say, not only the pressure but also the temperature
of the air and the tension of vapour were known). In some isolated cases the
hour of observation was not the same as that of the reference station; in this
case the readings were compared with those taken at the nearest hour, without
attempting to obtain values by interpolation, which would necessarily have been
unreliable.^[^2007]^

When all the necessary data were known for the two stations of reference—in
other words, the pressure, the temperature and the vapour tension—the well-known
formula of Rühlmann was employed to calculate the differences of level:—

:::: { .wrap-80 .align-center  }

::::
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

| *λ* = the latitude;

| *ζ*  = the height of the lower station above sea level.<br /><br />

The calculations were made by means of the Tables *météorologiques
internationales,* Paris, 1890.

In those cases where only the pressure and the temperature of the air were
known, the tension of vapour not being determined, the formula used was that
given in the *Annnuaire pour l' an 1909 publiƈ par le Bureau des Longitudes,* in
which are also included some tables that facilitated the calculations. The
formula is as follows :—

:::: { .wrap-80 .align-center  }

::::

in which

:::: { .wrap-80 .align-center  }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_410e.jpg ""){#b410e}
::::

the symbols having the same meaning as before.

In this approximate formula no account is taken of the humidity of the air, but
to make up for this we have assumed 0.004 as the coefficient of expansion of the
air instead of 0.00367.

When it is only a question of isolated observations, we consider this formula
more than sufficient in consequence of the uncertainty of the law of decrease of
temperature with increase of altitude.

For further proof, and to show more clearly the value that we can attribute to
the individual observations in the pages that follow, we give in addition to the
observations taken by the Duke those obtained simultaneously at the reference
stations, drawn as far as Leh and Srinagar are concerned from the data obtained
from the central observatory at Simla, and for those of Skardu and Gilgit from
the observatory of Srinagar.

It is not necessary to enter here into the value of the barometric method in
calculating altitudes. If this method is not on the whole to be compared with
the geodetic in precision, still, used with care, it may lead to very
satisfactory results.

We give in the following table the measurements obtained by the Duke in 1906 in
the Ruwenzori group by means of barometric measurements and those taken two
years later with the geodetic method by Major R.G.T. Bright,^[^2008]^ during the labours
of the Boundary Commission for the delimitation of the boundaries of the Congo
Free State :—

:::: { .wrap-100 .align-center  }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_411.jpg ""){#b411}
::::

Practically identical results were also attained in the determination of the
altitude of Mount St. Elias :—

* Altitude determined by the Duke with barometric method, 18,090 feet. 
* *Id.* by Russel (by triangulation), 18,100 feet.
* *Id.* by I. K. MacGrath, U.S. Coast Survey (by triangulation), 18,024 feet.

But there is no doubt that the best results are those obtained from a long series
of observations, and that greater uncertainty remains in the case of those based on
isolated observations, especially when the tension of vapour has not been determined.

The last table contains a summary of all the altimetric data.

THE fundamental outlines of our knowledge of the geology of the Karakoram range
and of Baltistan are still, in the main, those drawn by the labours of Col. H.
H. Godwin Austen and of R. Lydekker; but though the map published by the latter
in 1883, and reproduced on a smaller scale in the second edition of the Manual
of the Geology of India, published in 1891, was coloured geologically up to the
supposed watershed of the Karakoram range, exploration had not in fact been
pushed so far and the sources of the Baltoro were, at that time, in every way
unknown.

Later explorers had made no noteworthy contributions to the geology of the
region if we except the record of limestones on the Crystal Peak and the
sedimentary rocks of Golden Throne reported by Sir W. M. Conway, and the good
fortune—one may say merit—was reserved for the expedition led by H.R.H. the Duke
of the Abruzzi, of collecting observations which are not only new but to a great
extent unexpected, because, notwithstanding their importance and obviousness,
they had escaped the notice of previous travellers. Moreover, they form a
complement to those which were almost simultaneously being made by Dr.
Longstaff’s expedition at a distance of about 30 miles to the south-east, in the
valley of the Siachen glacier, and hence come to throw great light on the nature
and constitution of that little-known portion of the heart of the great Asiatic
continent.

In working out the geological results of the Italian expedition, the
observations and reports made by its several members have been utilised, as well
as the lithological material collected by them. The greater part of the
specimens, indeed almost the whole, were obtained from the glacier moraines, for
the approach to the rock-walls of the Upper Baltoro, though not impossible, is
frequently dangerous on account of the avalanches of snow and rocks precipitated
at every moment from these precipices, which measure not hundreds but thousands
of feet in height. The points where the rocks are directly accessible are
therefore somewhat rare, and consequently the specimens collected from rock *in
situ* are few in number.

Fortunately the material obtained from the moraines was not fortuitously
collected, but the moraines running along a transverse section at the junction
of the Upper Baltoro with the Godwin Austen glaciers were consecutively numbered
and the more characteristic material collected from each of them. Since it is
possible to determine the origin of the material forming the principal moraines
in this part of the glacier, a tolerably good idea may be formed of the
constitution of the slopes from which each is derived. Further on will he found
a list of these moraines and their lithological composition as reported by Dr.
F. De Filippi.

The rocks of which specimens were procured belong to the two categories of
crystalline schists and sedimentary deposits, with the addition of certain
specimens of serpentine. Apart from this last there are no representatives of
eruptive rocks, although granite is highly developed in the mountains of the
Baltoro valley; evidently the abundance of limestone and other sedimentary rocks
attracted and particularly engaged the attention of the ltalians.

### A.—SCHISTS AND CRYSTALLINE ROCKS.

The specimens of crystalline schists are few in comparison with those of
sedimentary rocks, but fortunately the more important of them were collected in
situ, and the place of origin is consequently known.

Along with the crystalline schists will be described certain specimens of
mineral veins, which must traverse them, and the noble serpentine, although this
should be associated stratigraphically with the more recent rocks, rather than
with the crystalline schists.

I\. *Biotite gneiss.*—The specimen was collected by H.R.H. the Duke of the
Abruzzi on Bride Peak, from the last rock of the eastern ridge at an altitude of
24,600 feet, on July 18th, 1909.

It is a slightly biotitic gneiss, dark coloured, of fine grain, but not
sufficiently so for it to become cryptocrystalline, and showing banded
structure. It is probably flaggy, though the smallness of the fragment prevents
this being affirmed with certainty. The grain is homogeneous and uniform. The
biotite does not form continuous sheets, but appears in isolated flakes. To the
naked eye small greenish spots are noticeable, due to amphibole.

Under the microscope the rock is seen to be composed of quartz, felspat, biotite
and amphibole, and as subordinate and accessory constituents, sphene, zircon,
apatite, as well as occasional calcite.

The quartz occurs in granular aggregates, frequently drawn out in the form of
lenticles lying parallel to the foliation; quantitatively it is subordinate to
the felspat, and shows neither undulate extension nor mechanical fracture.

The felspat is of two kinds. Orthoclase is the predominant form always slightly
opaque through incipient alteration. Cleavage is very distinct and always
visible. From a study of the disposition of the cleavage planes and their
relative frequency in sections cut parallel or transverse to the foliation it is
evident that the individual crystals are arranged with the axis of the two
directions of cleavage (001) (010) parallel to the foliation.

The orthoclase individuals have irregular outlines, are always larger than those
of quartz, of which they sometimes enclose rounded granules. The maximum
dimension of the granules of orthoclase attains 0,6 millimetre, but, on the
average, is rather less than half this figure. Small plates of mica are commonly
found in the intervals between the separate granules,

The other felspat is marked as albite by its polysynthetic twining and the index
of refraction being less than that of quartz. It is very rare in comparison with
the orthoclase.

The biotite occurs without any crystal faces, except the basal plane; the flakes
have a very irregular outline as seen in a thin section, much elongated in the
direction of the basal plane. The maximum dimensions are 0,55 millimetre in the
direction of *c* and 0.70 millimetre in the direction perpendicular to this,
that is to say, parallel to the basal plane.

The biotite occurs in two sizes. The larger lie along the foliation planes and
are arranged in similar orientation. The smaller, which have already been
noticed when speaking of the felspat, occur in extremely minute flakes and lying
in any direction in the interstices of the aggregate of quartz and felspat
forming the ground mass of the rock.

The Diotite is brown and exhibits the following pleochroism:— <br /><br />

:::: align-center
n~p~ = **a** = pale yellow<br />
n~m~ = **b** = brown<br />
n~g~ = **c** = brown.<br /><br />
::::

There is very little difference between n~m~ and n~g~, the absorption parallel
to the basal plane is not great, as the mineral has preserved its transparency
and pale brown colour; it is sensibly uniaxial in convergent light.

The mica in general is quite fresh and shows no sign of chemical alteration or
mechanical deformation.

The amphibole has the habit of actinolite, always in rather slender prisms, for
the most part grouped in bundles with their axes parallel to the foliation. It
is constantly associated with mica, but, notwithstanding this connection, does
not seem to be derived from the latter, which, as has been mentioned, is always
quite fresh.

The angle of maximum extinction is almost exactly 15°, but not greater. The
pleochroism is as follows:—<br /><br />

:::: align-center
n~g~ = **c** = blue green with notable absorption<br />
n~m~ = **b** = bright green with a slight tendency to brown<br />
n~p~ = **a** = very pale green<br />
**a** < **b** < **c**.<br /><br />
::::

The maximum length of the groups of prisms is 1 millimetres, the mean width of
each prism 0.05 to 0.06 millimetre.

Among the necessary minerals sphene is abundant and in comparatively large
grains. The calcite is certainly of secondary origin.

The structure of the rock is interesting, particularly as seen in sections
perpendicular to the foliation, on account of the regular distribution of the
coloured constituents, especially the mica, which is much more abundant than the
amphibole, and of a certain uniformity of dimension of the grains of quartz and
felspat: this is a type of hornstone structure, characteristic of rocks
metamorphosed by contact with granite. In the sections examined no mineral
characteristic of contact metamorphism, as, for instance, andalusite, was seen
but the structure and character, especially of the biotite, convey the
impression of a rock of this character. Should future observation confirm this
it will have to be admitted that the granite of the Baltoro neighbourhood is
more recent than the crystalline schists which are in contact with, and have
been metamorphosed by, it.

II\. *Noble Serpentine.*—Typical specimens of this were collected along the whole
course of the Baltoro. They were also found in the moraines of the upper reaches
and it is probable that it is intrusive in the sedimentary rocks. Lydekker
records this mineral as occurring in the Shigar region in the supra-Kuling
series, of mesozoic, perhaps upper mesozoic age; it was also determined by Prof.
T. G. Bonney and Miss A. C. Raisin^[^2009]^ in specimens collected by Sir M. Conway from
White Fan Pass, a little east of Crystal Peak.

III\. *Vein Quartz.*—In variety. Two specimens were collected by His Royal
Highness on Bride Peak, along with the biotite gneiss already described, others
in the moraines of the Baltoro. The latter enclose pyrites and arsenical pyrites
or mispickel; these very common minerals would be of no importance but that they
may indicate a possible origin of the gold which near Skardu and elsewhere is
found in small quantities in the alluvium of the Upper Indus and its
tributaries, possibly in doubly derivative occurrence, as Lydekker found traces
of gold workings in the alluvial terraces at about 120 feet above the present
level of the Indus. Probably the pyrites of the quartz veins is sufficiently
auriferous to give rise on its decomposition to the scanty gold which is met
with in these river gravels.

### B.—SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.

The rocks of palpably sedimentary origin, collected in the Baltoro moraines,
fall into two principal groups: one composed of schists and silicons
anagenites,^[^2010]^ the other of most various limestones, dolomites and calcareous
breccias.

The first group contains many types, which, individually, seem tolerably
different from each other, but, considered as a whole, yield so many
intermediate types as to suggest an origin from one and the same series of
strata. The prototype is a rock composed of small rounded fragments of quartz
imbedded in a micaceous matrix, and may be described as a reddish violet
anagenite with the quartzose component generally of small dimensions, and of
white, reddish and greenish colour, imbedded in a distinctly schistose micaceous
(sericitic) matrix. With the disappearance of the quartz fragments this rock
passes into a thoroughly typical violet-coloured sericite schist. At times the
quartz grains increase in size and abundance till the rock, being strongly
cleaved, assumes a characteristically gneissose appearance; at others the
sericitic cement becomes so cryptocrystalline as to assume a wax-like
appearance. Occasionally the whole rock seems to have undergone an alteration
which has given it an argillaceous appearance, recalling that of some
porphyrites or porphyritic tuffs, which have been altered into argillites.

Less abundant as compared with these rocks, all more or less reddish in colour,
are others, quite analogous, of greenish grey colour, which probably alternate
with the former because, except for the colour of the micaceous matrix, they
consist of the same elements.^[^2011]^

The calcareous group presents an extraordinary wealth of varieties and can be
divided into three sub-groups: limestones, comprising also dolomites and
dolomitic limestones, coloured marbles, and breccias, the latter more abundant
than all the other rocks.

The first sub-group includes white, grey and black-banded limestones, and
whitish and yellowish dolomites. One crystalline limestone in particular
deserves special mention: it is a fine-grained, almost waxy looking limestone,
sometimes marbled with fine grey lines, sometimes having the appearance of
cipolin, which is probably derived from lenticular masses included in the gneiss
or mica schist.

In the group of coloured marbles the prevailing variety is a very beautiful red
marble with small white spots, and various other types, all having a red
coloured base and white veins,

There comes finally the group of breccias, which presents no small variation,
both in the nature of the fragments and in that of the cement, in the colour of
one or the other, and so on. Noteworthy is a whole series of breccias of
calcareous fragments, bound together by a reddish micaceous substance, quite
analogous with the matrix of the anagenites. Better than any description as a
help to an appreciation of the range of colours of these breccias, is the fact
that they present many analogies with the varieties of marble from the Apuan
Alps and other parts of taly.

Certain speeimens, intermediate between the breccias and marbles, are formed of
a soft, dark red, calcarcous schist, seamed with veins of calcite, which gives
place, when associated with white limestone, to a white marble with
violet-coloured amygdaloidal patches, and dark red veining, and to a dark red
and white marble breceia with green variegation, altogether similar to the rosso
di Levanto; but while the latter is a typical ophicalcite, as much cannot be
said of the Baltoro specimens, in which the green is due to variegation of the
schistose portion. It is, however, to be noted that we are unot impossibly
dealing with an extreme form of true ophicaleite, as fragments of noble
serpentine are found in the moraine along with this hreccia.

The specimens collected at the camping grounds of the explorers are insufficient
for an attempt to arrange the various types in their order of geological
sequence. The only hypothesis which can be hazarded is that probably some of the
calcareous breccias with micaceons cement come from the contact zone of the
schists and anagenites with the limestone and dolomite. In the Apuan Alps very
similar breccias (*mischio di Saravezza*) occur at the contact between the lower
limestones (grezzon) and the underlying schists, which lave been ascribed to the
permian, others, on the contrary, occur at the contact of the said grezzoni with
the zone of marbles, etc. All these breccias appear to he due to mechanical
action and are consequently referable to crush breccias.

Owing to the absence of organic remains among the material collected by the
Italian expedition, no direct determination of the geological age of the
formations is possible, and the only way to arrive at even a very approximate
determination is by comparison of the specimens collected with the rocks already
studied and known in other parts of the district. According to the work of
Lydekker and Godwin-Austen, confirmed by later observation, a great complex of
formations occurs in a syncline, between Shigar and Askoley, in Baltistan, and
in the range rising west of the Biafo glacier. This complex, formed by
alternations of schist, limestone, dolomite containing serpentine, and,
according to Col. Godwin-Austen, also quartzites, may well be the equivalent of
the formations met with in the Upper Baltoro valley. Mr. Lydekker gives two
sections across this formation and mentions dolomitic limestones, blue and white
mottled limestones, pure white and blue limestones with red veins, green and
black schists, the latter carbonaceous and calcareous, and so forth, besides
brown grits, which may be the reddish anagenites and identical with the
quartzites of Colonel Godwin-Austen. In short the rocks are all such as are
present in the moraines of the Upper Baltoro glacier. Mr. Lydekker also mentions
dolomites and limestones with characteristic red stains, identical with those
found in the supra-Kuling series of Chang-cheng-mo.^[^2012]^ It is not, therefore, too
risky to assume that the same formations, but with a much greater development of
limestones in comparison with the other rocks, are repeated to the cast of K^2^
and form the Broad-Gasherbrum~Golden Throne group of mountains.

The beds of the series forming the above-mentioned. so-called^[^2013]^ Baltistan-Braldol
syncline are ascribed by Mr. Lydekker, on account of their resemblance to other
fossiliferous rocks of the district, to his Zanskar system, named after a
district in Kashmir, and attributed to a carbon-mesozoic age. The series which
is fossiliferous at Shigar, and comparable with that met with on the Sasser
Karakoram track, certainly includes the permian and trias, together with older
beds at the base and newer ones above. With all reservation necessary in the
present case, we may, provisionally, accept a similar correlation for the
sedimentary series of the Upper Baltoro, all the more so as I shall shortly set
forth other arguments in favour of this hypothesis.

A sufficiently clear idea of the topographical distribution of these sedimentary
rocks in the mountains of the Upper Baltoro may be formed from the series of
moraine ridges immediately below the confluence of the Baltoro with the
GodwinAusten glacier, along a line drawn from north to south.^[^2014]^

According to Dr. De Filippi the succession is as follows:—

1. A large moraine of granite, gneiss, and crystalline rocks, derived from the
   range on the left of the glacier from Bride Peak to Masherbrum.

2. Moraine of limestone fragments, rich in coloured marbles and limestone
   breccias, which have fallen from the western flanks of Golden Throne.

3. Narrow moraine of schistose slaty rocks, which unites with the preceding one
   a little lower down.

4. A great moraine of calcareous fragments, coloured marbles, breccias and
anagenites of various colours, with a predominance of wine red, which descends
from Hidden Peak and the southern buttresses of Gasherbrum. With this moraine
the contribution of the Upper Baltoro ceases and gives way to that of the
Godwin-Austen glacier. 

5. Moraine of limestone fragments collected along the slopes of Broad Peak.

6. Median moraine, coming from the southern and western slopes of K^2^, the
   prevailing constituents being granite and crystalline schists with some
   scattered fragments of limestone.

7. Right hand marginal moraine, with the same composition as the preceding, but
   becoming richer in limestone fragments below the white limestone peak, which
   rises to the south-cast of Crystal Peak, at the confluence of the Baltoro and
   Godwin-Austen glaciers.

The observations made by Dr. De Filippi, the beautiful photographs of Vittorio
Sella, and the material determined and discussed in the preceding pages, make it
possible to draw the outlines of a sketch of the geological constitution of the
mountains of the Upper Baltoro and to study their relations to other districts
geologically known.

From the end of the glacier near Paiju up to the confluence of the Godwin-Austen
glacier, the Baltoro valley is opened through the gneisses and granites of the
Baltistan massif, according to the unanimous description of all explorers. It is
possible, however, that crystalline limestone might be intercalated in this
series of crystalline schists, for Lydekker mentions^[^2015]^ having met with it in the
Hushe valley, which descends southwards from Masherbrum in the heart of the
gneissic area.

Certain of Sella’s photographs, however, led me to entertain some doubt of the
entirely gneissic character of the Lower Baltoro valley. In the preliminary
account of the journey, published by the ltalian Geographical Society,^[^2016]^ it is
mentioned that the mountains on the right of the Baltoro in front of Rdokass are
gigantic, with vertical flanks, and peaks of superb and fantastic forms,
sometimes of formidable towers, at others of sharply pointed pyramids. As the
photographs and telephotographs show, these irregular forms are confined to the
upper parts of the mountains and seem to be the remnants of an enormous, nearly
horizontal layer superimposed on the massive gneiss. The forms, in short, of
these mountains reproduce the appearance of the dolomitic towers of the Alps, so
that it is at least justifiable to doubt whether there may not be, in this part
of the Mustagh, the remains of a capping of sedimentary rock regularly covering
the gneiss and forming what is known in modern terminology as a “lambeau de
recouvrement,” composed of dolomites, overthrust on to the gneiss and granites
of Baltistan.

Apart from dolomite, the only rock, with which I am acquainted, capable of
assuming such forms is the protogene, a special form of granite, of Mont Blanc.
Since four glaciers descend from the cliffs in question it will be easy for a
later examination to confirm or refute this hypothesis by an examination of the
moraines.^[^2017]^

Ascending the valley, the mountains suggest no change of character till the
confluence of the Godwin-Austen glacier is approached. On the right of the
Baltoro, opposite and north of Mitre Peak, a marble crag rises from one of the
buttresses of Crystal Mountain, and is marked in the map of the Italian
expedition by the figure 20088. The peak is most recognisable because the
summit, composed of pure white marble, rises from a base of dark-coloured
schists. The dip of the schists, though steep, is distinctly eastwards above,
but lower down becomes perfectly vertical, where the beds are seen plunging
perpendicularly into the Godwin-Austen glacier.

As it was not possible to secure authentic specimens, either of the schists of
the base or of the marble, we must have recourse to conjecture. In the material
of the moraine the only white marble is a saccharoid limestone of very fine
grain, with suggestions of cipolin, derived from the moraine on the Baltoro in
direct correspondence with this peak. Is this mass of marble simply a great
lenticular inclusion of crystalline limestone in the Baltistan gneiss, like that
of Masherbrum, or, does it belong to the overlying group forming the massif
opposite to it, from which it seems separated by some local accident of
structure or sculpture? The material for answering these questions is not to
hand.

West of the marble peak lies a saddle named by Sir W. M. Conway, White Fan pass,
beyond which rises his Crystal Peak, not that so named on the Ttalian map, but
one of its minor peaks. Among the specimens collected by Sir W. M. Conway, on
the ascent of his Crystal Peak, Prof. T. G. Bonney and Miss A. C. Raisin
identified^[^2018]^ a fine-grained gneiss, a calcitie quartz schist, a dark-coloured
mica schist, a dolomite, and a limestone. both crystalline. From the White Fan
pass came a mica syenite and a fine-grained crystalline dolomite. All these are
rocks of a crystalline series and, except the syenite, of the schistose group.
The presence of unaltered sedimentary rocks in the Baltoro moraines, opposite
Crystal Peak, led Prof. Bonney and Miss Raisin to propose the hypothesis that
sedimentary formations were represented in the rock forming this mountain. Now
that we know that sedimentary rocks form the whole of Gasherbrum, from which the
greatest part of the moraine material of the Baltoro is derived, Prof. Bonney's
conjecture becomes baseless, and the presence of sedimentary rocks in the
vicinity of Cryvstal Peak problematical.^[^2019]^

The formation of schists, anagenites, limestones and dolomites shows up in its
full development in the terminal mass, lying between the Godwin-Austen and Upper
Baltoro glaciers, which is crowned by the three peaks Broad, Gasherbrum and
Hidden, rising to heights of more than 26,500 feet (8,000 metres). The
limestones predominate in the high portion of the Broad and Gasherbrum
mountains, the base of schists is seen to fringe the foot of these mountains
along the whole of the left bank of the Godwin-Austen and eastwards along the
right bank of the Upper Baltoro glaciers, to almost opposite Mitre Peak. Beyond
this point the limestones extend down to the base, and on the left of the
photographic view of Bride Peak from Camp III the mass of limestones, bristling
with peaks and pinnacles, is seen to rise from the glacier.

The boundary between the limestones and schists is, consequently, covered by ice
in the valley, but certainly rises towards the dip between the calcareous Golden
Throne and the gneissic Bride, and probably crosses Chogolisa pass.

Among the specimens collected by Sir W. M. Conway on the second pinnacle of
Pioneer Peak, one of the peaks of Golden Throne, is a purple schistose grit with
small pebbles, mentioned by Prof. Bonney and Miss Raisin^[^2020]^, which may be
identical with the anagenite of this report.

As appears from specimens collected by His Royal Highness, at a height of 24,600
feet, Bride Peak is composed above of gneiss, and at the base of the granites
and granitoid gneisses, so extremely abundant, according to the observations of
the members of the Italian expedition, in the moraines of the glacier which
descends from this mountain.

In the Upper Godwin-Austen glacier the boundary between the gneiss and the beds
of the palwo-mesozoic series must lie to the south of Windy Gap, as the
Staircase is made of coarse-grained, light greyish gneiss.

The base of the highest peak of the neighbourhood, K^2^, ought, according to the
reports of various expeditions, to be formed of light-coloured granites or
granitoid gneisses. But the several photographs taken from south, east and west
show a well marked stratification with gentle dips of about 15° to 20°, which is
greatest in the terminal pyramid; it is probably due to layers of gneiss
analogous to those of Bride Peak. Colonel Godwin Austen, who noticed this
peculiarity in the photographs brought back by the Italian expedition, expressed
the opinion^[^2021]^ that the stratified summit of K^2^ might be more recent than the
granite base. I cannot accept this opinion of the illustrious and learned
explorer without reservation. The mere fact of superposition is not enough to
establish the relative age of two formations in a highly disturbed region, all
the more so as the granite may be intrusive.

The scarcity of specimens obtained from rock *in situ* leaves many questions
obscure. Are the schists of the base of Broad Peak the same as those of the
Marble Peak? Do they belong to the crystalline schists as Dr. De Filippi
believes, or to the paleo-mesozoic series? At present no answer is possible.

One other question remains unsettled, the direction of the dip of the contact
between the schists and limestones at the base of Broad Peak. The course of the
junction from Windy Gap to the Chogolisa pass, taking into account the
difference of level, is nearly north and south, but none of the photographs have
enabled the dip to be determined. Taking into acconnt what is seen on the Marble
Peak it is probable that the dip is very high and nearly vertical, with a
tendency towards inversion to an apparent easterly dip.^[^2022]^  From Mr. Lydekker’s
observations we know that at Askoley, in the Braldoh valley, the contact between
the sedimentary series and the gneiss of Baltistan hades to the east, that is to
say, the gneiss is inverted over the more recent rocks. If this explanation is
rejected we must believe that there is a superposition in normal chronological
order.

Notwithstanding the great gaps, which yet remain in our knowledge of the geology
of the mountains of the Baltoro glacier, one fact of greatest importance has
been established. The valley of the great glacier is closed on the north by a
very elevated massif, composed of sedimentary rocks of upper palmozoic and
mesozoic age, prevailingly calcareous and, therefore, differing widely from the
mountains of the rest of the valley, which are entirely, or prevailingly,
granitic and gneissic.

This difference explains how the course of the junction between these types of
rock has determined that of the longitudinal furrow, formed by two subsequent
valleys, which give origin to the bifurcation of the valley into the two
branches of the Upper Baltoro and the Godwin-Austen, descending, respectively,
from the Chogolisa pass and Windy Gap. The vallev of the Baltoro has, therefore,
a certain analogy with that of the Upper Aosta, which ends in the two
longitudinal valleys of the Allée Blanehe and Ferret, meeting at Entréves, at
the foot of Mont Blanc, to form the strictly transverse valley of the Dora di
Valdigne. Geologically and lithologically the Baltoro valley is, to a certain
extent, the opposite of the Aosta, because, while the latter is formed of
schistose limestone rocks and shut in by a granite mass, the former is cut
through granitic and gneissic mountains and closed by a mass of schists and
limestones, which ought to be named after the Broad Peak, as this rising to
27,133 feet forms the highest point, rather than the customary Gasherbrum, which
will be retained as it has become established by use.

From the distribution of morenic material in the glaciers of the group it seems
fairly probable that the terminal peaks of Broad, Gasherbrum IV, Hidden and
Golden Throne are all formed of limestone and dolomite. They will consequently
be the first peaks of over or near 26,500 feet known to be formed of sedimentary
rocks, whereas the loftiest summits previously known are composed of granitie,
gneissic rocks, or else formed by volcanic ones. Allowing for difference of
scale, the Broad group may be taken to represent, in the Karakoram, the Grand
Combin, in the Alps—the only peak formed of sedimentary rocks (mesozoic
calcareous schists of Piedmontese facies) which rises above 13,000 feet.

It we regard the general geological structure of the region, as shown by
geological maps and descriptions, the discovery of the great mass of limestones
of the Upper Baltoro appears clearly as the continuation, and harmonic
complement, of the structural outlines which had been suggested, but left
uncertain, by earlier exploration to the south-east. For a long time the
presence of paleo-mesozoic rocks in the Chang-cheng-mo-Karakoram region of
Eastern Ladakh has been known; they have been described by Dr. Stoliczka in
1878, and at a later date by Mr. Lydekker, who found dolomites with upper trias
fossils. This paleo-mesozoic area forms an elongated strip running
north-westwards parallel to the direction of the gneissic mass of Baltistan. It
had been traced to Sirsil, between the Nubra and Shyok valleys, on the road to
the Karakoram pass, but its ultimate course and end remained unknown. The
calcareous dolomitic mass of Gasherbrum lies approximately on the north-west
prolongation of this band, and the discovery, by Dr. Longstaff, of limestone in
the median moraine of the upper Siachen glacier, at a place intermediate between
Sirsil and the Upper Baltoro. is a weighty argument in favour of the continuity
of this band of mesozoic limestone for some 90 miles, through a region which is
yet unexplored, even geographically.

The importance of this discovery is not merely geological but also, and
principally, geographical. The course of the watershed, between the Indus valley
and the closed drainage area of Turkestan, from the Mustagh to the Karakoram
pass. was uncertain and badly known, in spite of certain peaks having been
trigonometrically fixed, as it had been barely seen and never crossed by the
explorers who followed each other at long intervals.

The Italian expedition obtained, from Windy Gap, on 15th June, 1909, the first
view over the unknown country east of the mountains bounding the Baltoro
glacier, and saw, to the left of Gasherbrum, not the valley of the Oprang
tributary of the Yarkand, seen a few days previously by His Royal Highness from
the Savoia pass to the west of K^2^, but another valley, with a glacier draining
to the south-east.

:::: { .wrap-60  }
![&nbsp;](Karakoram_440.jpg ""){#b440}
::::

Almost simultaneously, on 16th June, 1909, Dr. Longstaff crossed the presumed
watershed by the Saltoro pass and descended onto a glacier which, a couple of
months later, was suspected on the suggestion of Colonel Burrard to be the upper
portion of the Saichar or Siachen glacier, previously known only at its lower
end, and believed to have a length of about 20 miles, instead of the 45 miles it
is now known to reach. The source of the Siachen is thus pushed back to an
untraversed pass, seen by Dr. Longstaff from an estimated distance of 12 miles,
and supposed to be the same as that reported, from the northern side, at the
head of the Urdok glacier by Sir F. Younghusband, in his exploration of the
Oprang valley in 1889; a pass which seems to lie in about the same latitude as
Golden Throne. In the mountains to the east of this pass, to which Dr. Longstaff
gave the name of Younghusband, he noted the very lofty peak of Teram Kangri,
whose height, estimated approximately at 27,610 feet, makes it one of the
loftiest mountains of the world.^[^2023]^

Finally he noticed that the moraines on the left of this upper Siachen glacier,
like those on the right of the upper Baltoro, were full of marbles and
calcareous breccias, and saw, some ten miles off, the rocks of Teram Kangri
gleam white, where not, covered with snow; facts which led him unhesitatingly to
the conclusion that this superb mountain was formed of limestone. This
statement, which might appear rash, if unsupported, attains a certain
probability from the observations and records of the Italian expedition in the
Gasherbrum massif.^[^2024]^ The mountain mass of Teram Kangri lies about south-east of
Broad Peak, and on the line joining this with the limestone band recorded
between the Nubra and Upper Shyok valleys and from its eastern declivities by
Mr. Lydekker, to the south of the Sirsil or Sasser pass.

This unexpected extension of the Siachen glacier to the vicinity of the
mountains at the head of the Baltoro gives great importance to the observations
of the Italian expedition, whether from Windy Gap or the Chogolisa pass, as has
already been briefly referred to in the addresses given by His Royal Highness
and published in various scientific periodicals.^[^2025]^

As regards Windy Gap, this has already been dealt with. The camp on the
Chogolisa pass commanded the valley of the Kondus, a glacier which was seen to
intervene between the Baltoro and the recently discovered Upper Siachen. The
valley of the Kondus, dominated by the peaks K^7^, K^8^, K^9^, winds tortuously,
first to the cast, then to the north, passing round the bases of Golden Throne
and Hidden Peaks. This last is not the most easterly peak of the Gasherbrum
group, for eastwards of Hidden Peak rises another, and only to the cast of this
does a deep gap form the true limit of the Gasherbrum massif, taken in a wide
sense, and the head of the Kondus glacier. The Italian expedition believed that
this was in truth the pass at the head of the Urdok glacier, seen from the
Oprang side by Younghusband, and for this reason.

Beside this depression another was seen, formed by a low ridge, separating the
Kondus from a wide, glacier-filled valley further east, which is probably none
other than the Upper Siachen. The low crest just mentioned rises rapidly towards
the south into the high mountains between the Kondus and the supposed Siachen,
and to the east into other lofty mountains, which should be the easterly or
northerly continuation of Teram Kangri, if not this mountain itself.

From the saddle at the head of the Kondus it seems possible to descend to the
Oprang basin, and probably into the Urdok valley.

If the map accompanying Dr. Longstaff’s account of his expedition is compared
with the representation of the Kondus valley, which has just been set forth, it
is evident that there are no irreconcilable differences. The Kondus and Siachen
glaciers end in two depressions, separated by a low crest, which, seen from a
distance, might be superimposed on each other by an effect of perspective, so as
to give the impression of a single valley, especially from the relatively low
point where Longstaff was upon the Siachen, at about 16,000 feet, an impression
less probable from the camps of His Royal Highness on Chogolisa, at an elevation
of 22,000 feet, equal to, if not greater than, that of the pass in question.
From this it follows that the westernmost extremity of the Siachen valley will
not communicate directly with the Urdok, but only with the Kondus, whose head
intervenes, so to speak, between the valleys of the Siachen and Urdok, and that
the pass seen by Sir F. Younghusband lies between this latter and the Kondus
valley.

A discovery so important as that of the greater extension of the Siachen has
given wide field for conjecture and hypothesis, and to considerable divergence
of interpretation, a thing which is natural in view of the many uncertainties
still existing. Dr. Longstaff, and still more distinctly Dr. Neve, his companion
in part of the expedition, have expressed in their writings the opinion that the
Siachen communicates with the Baltoro directly over a saddle at the base of
Hidden Peak, or to the north of it, in the same way that the Biafo glacier in
Baltistan communicates with the Hispar. In the first place this supposed
continuity of the two glaciers does not exist, South of the Broad massif the
Kondus glacier, as has been mentioned, is insinuated between them. The valleys
which descend to the east and north of the massif are tributaries of the Oprang,
either by means of the Gasherbrum glacier of Younghusband, or by the Urdok;
consequently there can be no direct connection between the Siachen and Baltoro
glaciers. Yet, broadly speaking, the notion implied by these authors might he
extended across the gap formed by the Upper Kondus, and it might be maintained
that the Baltoro and Siachen, in spite of a brief interruption, lie in the same
tectonic furrow and so preserve the analogy desired by Dr. Longstaff. But not
even in this way is it correct, for the Biafo-Hispar system is formed by two
longitudinal valleys draining in opposite directions, in a furrow which is
orographically, and geologically, a single well-marked feature. The
Siachen-Baltoro system, on the other hand, would consist of a longitudinal
valley draining to the south-east, joined by a series of gaps and valleys, found
along its prolongation to the north-west, with the distinctly transverse valley
of the Lower Baltoro. The supposed analogy therefore does not exist, even on
this hypothesis; on the contrary, it is obvious that the Siachen furrow
continues into the Urdok across the two contiguous saddles.

From the observations made by the two expeditions it results that the course of
the water parting between the Indus and Yarkand basins is very different from
what had been believed and shown on maps.

The Karakoram, like the Himalaya, of which it is the western portion, consists
of a series of chains parallel to each other, and also approximately parallel to
the course of the geological zones and leading tectonic features, ill-known as
yet, of the whole great system. The rivers flow in open valleys between these
chains, and narrow, deep-cut channels, frequently reduced to impassable gorges,
by which the rivers pass from one valley to the next, sever the chains in
pieces. Consequently, although the lines of peaks appear continuous on the map
and exhibit a sensible parallelism, the principal watershed, and many of the
secondary ones, have a very different course, proceeding by stretches as they
pass from one range to another by means of transverse ridges, which separate the
divergent slopes of each of the furrows contained between a pair of ranges.

On the whole then, as this passage of the watershed from one to the next
takes place for long stretches in a regular manner, always from a more forward
range to one further back, the complex course of the line of watershed cuts, at
a very acute angle, the general direction of the ranges, so that it is easy, in
ill-known parts of the system, to confound two quite distinct members with each
other and regard them as only one. Just this confusion was made in all maps
anterior to 1910 in the country between the Upper Baltoro and the Karakoram
pass.

The discovery of the Upper Siachen, and of Teram Kangri, has shown the existence
of a great longitudinal furrow, occupied by a glacier, and of a chain, parallel
to that, well known and fixed, which runs from K^2^ to Hidden Peak and, up to
now, was called the main range of the Karakoram. The ridge by which the
watershed crosses from this to that of Teram Kangri is formed by that saddle
between the head of the Kondus and the Siachen which was seen from Chogolisa.
The chain of K^2^ is truncated by the Kondus valley, whose tortuous course in
the upper part indicates a breach of continuity, filled with ice, but where this
disappears, exhibiting itself as one of those impassable gorges in which the
Karakoram is rich. It is probable that the continuation of the chain of K^2^ is
that in which the peaks K^9^ and K^10_11^ are found, these latter over 25,000 feet
in height, and in the Saltoro chain to K^12^ and beyond.

It is natural to enquire what may be the influence, on the morphology of the
region, of the junction between the crystalline and sedimentary rocks, which, in
the Upper Baltoro valley, determines the furrow extending from Windy Gap to the
Chogolisa pass. Probably it crosses the Upper Kondus valley and cuts the ridge
between this and the Siachen to the east of K^10_11^, which present themselves,
orographically, as the homologue of Bride Peak, in secondary alignment parallel
to the principal range, and, geologically, as the continuation of the
crystalline axis of K^2^. If the depression along the plane of contact continues
farther to the south-cast, it should cross the Siachen valley and the
Murgisthang pass, to reach the known boundary on the Sasser pass. It is evident
therefore that, although this contact determines many and important orographical
details, it does not correspond to any great valley, and still less to a furrow
of primary rank, as is the case in the Biafo-Hispar valley. In conclusion it is
certain that the water parting between the Indus and the Central Asian drainage,
after passing the peaks of K^2^, Broad, Gasherbrum and Hidden, turns eastwards
to a parallel range which bounds the Siachen on the east and probably culminates
in Teram Kangri. A good part of this range was already known, for it runs from
the Sasser pass, for more than 100 miles south-eastwards to the Pangong Lake,
and is cut through by the precipitous gorge of the Shyok, in the reach which
lies above the sharp elbow formed by this river, a little below its junction
with the Chang-cheng-mo. The range of K^2^  runs south-west of this, and
although the complexity of its geological composition—for granites, schists and
various sedimentary rocks take part init—-has a very sensible influence in
multiplying and increasing the accidents of relief, it has not rendered less
evident the orographical continuity, which is obvious enough in many parts.

The two chains of K^2^ and Teram Kangri, are, therefore, well distinct, and the
resemblance between the Karakoram and the double chain of the Hindu Kush,
already suspected by some, has a real basis. The latest discoveries have
revealed the importance of the Teram Kangri range, which is promoted from the
position of a secondary spur of the presumed watershed range, to that of a
primary range of the system. The continuation of this range, to the northwards,
is certainly that row of peaks, which the Italian expedition observed from Windy
Gap, and which will now become the object of fresh journeys of exploration.

::::

Having been asked to undertake the translation and revision of the Appendix
dealing with the geological results of the expedition made by His Royal Highness
the Duke of the Abruzzi to the Karakoram, I find little left to be done as
regards the latter half of the task. The facts, as set forth by Ing. Novarese,
may be accepted, the interpretation follows, for the greater part, with logical
certainty. Only in two parts of any importance do I find myself unable to accept
unreservedly the opinions expressed in the note. The first of these concerns the
limestones of Crystal Peak and the hills eastwards of it. In the note they are
regarded, with very little hesitation, as belonging to the older gneissic
series, and as lenticular inclusions in it. This interpretation is not
impossible, but it seems to me that insufficient weight has been given to
earlier observations, and that the case for regarding the limestones as
belonging to the sedimentary series, either as a continuation of the Gasherbrum
exposure or as an outlier, is stronger than is represented by the text. Sir W.
M. Conway, in the description of his expedition, expressly states that on the
descent from his Crystal Peak he came upon “a new set of rocks which gave a
fresh character to the ridge separating the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers.”
These rocks are described as granites and hard limestones, light grey, buff and
white in colour, of which seams were found in the rocks lower down the valley
but here forming the mass of the mountains. His next camp up the glacier was
pitched on a fan composed of fragments of white marble.^[^2026]^ In the description of
the rocks collected *in situ* on these hills it is stated that no record was
kept of the order in which they were collected, but of the specimens one is
described as gneiss, one as mica schist, and five as various forms of
limestones; the other specimens are one of syenite and one of quartz associated
with limestone breceia.^[^2027]^ It may be noticed that the gneiss and mica schist
were both collected on the ascent of Crystal Peak, and that these rocks are
unrepresented in the collection from the White Fan pass: moreover, from the
latter locality came a greyish crystalline limestone, veined with noble
serpentine, recalling the presence of similar rocks among the moraine debris
derived from the Gasherbrum group of mountains, and the occurrence of serpentine
among the sedimentary rocks on the slopes of Mango Gusor.^[^2028]^

These facts render it at least possible that we have to deal with an exposure of
the limestone series, penetrated by intrusive veins of syenite and gneissose
granite, such as is not uncommon in the Himalayas. It may be that the boundary,
between the areas occupied mainly by crystalline and by sedimentary rocks, after
running down the Upper Baltoro valley, crosses the main glacier and passes up
onto the mountains north of it, thence, turning north-eastwards near the Crystal
Peak, it would run down to the valley of the Godwin-Austen glacier, striking it
near the sharp bend and following the general course of the upper part of this
valley. As an alternative the Crystal and Marble Peak exposure of limestones may
be an outlying area of sedimentary rocks, but in either alternative there is the
possibility, which should be investigated by future travellers, of the
occurrence of sedimentary limestones in the hills north of the Baltoro glacier.

The second point, on which something more remains to be said, is the minor
classification of the mountain ranges. The view advocated by Drs. Longstaff and
Neve is rejected on the ground that there is no structural continuity between
the Siachen, Baltoro and Biafo valleys, such as would give them a geological
unity and justify the mountains on either side being regarded as forming two
separate ranges; but, if this argument is allowed to prevail, it would equally
militate against the view which regards the mountains on either side of the
Oprang-Nubra trough as forming a pair of parallel ranges, for this orographical
depression certainly does not follow, but runs obliquely to the general strike
of the leading feature in the geological structure of the district, namely, the
Karakoram syncline of sedimentary rocks.

This argument is not, however, final, for the movements of elevation, which have
given rise to the mountains, were spread over a long period, and it may well be
that the latest of them, those which determined the rows of peaks as they now
stand, did not exactly follow the earlier ones, by which the leading features of
geological structure were marked out. Moreover, the case for the classification
adopted in the note is stronger than is there set forth, for not only is the
Oprang Nubra trough similar to the much larger depression formed by the Sutlej
and Sanpo valleys on the northern side of the Himalayas, but there is an
apparent connection between the two, for the former is continued south-eastwards
by the Shyok valley up to the elbow, where it bends from a southerly to a
north-westerly course, and thence by the lower part of the Pangong Lake to the
Upper Indus, and by this to the Sutlej valley. To the south-east this line of
valleys has been held to be sufficient reason for separating the Himalayas, on
the south, from the mountains to the north, so that if Ing. Novarese errs in
separating the Teram Kangri peaks from those of the K^2^ and Gasherbrum group,
he errs in good company. And if this view is accepted, then the series of peaks,
labelled K with a number by the Survey of India, can no longer be regarded as
belonging to the same range that is crossed by the Karakoram pass, and a
different name, Mustagh for choice, would have to be given to them and to the
mountains which have been repeatedly described as the Karakoram Himalayas.

It is, however, by no means certain that this view of the grouping of the peaks
into ranges is correct. It is natural for geographers to seek a parallelism
between the minor members of a great chain of mountains and the general
direction of the whole, and the intricacy of the valley systems, cut back at
times along the strike-line between minor ranges, and at others across and
through them, makes it not impossible to find justification for dividing the
mountain chain, as a whole, into a series of parallel ranges, running along the
length of the chain. Yet, although it may be possible to adopt a nomenclature
expressing this view, it does not follow that the names represent what really
occurs in nature, and there is another aspect of the case which is at least
equally worthy of consideration, that the individual members of the chain are
ranged not along, but obliquely transverse to, the general direction of the
whole, much like the arrangement of the individual birds in a flock of wild
geese, or the individual regiments of an army ranged in echelon.

The study of areas of structural elevation, on a smaller scale, and of less
complication, than a mountain range, shows that the principal anticline is often
crossed by minor ones, ranged obliquely to it, so that the margin of the area of
uplift is marked by a series of open folds, all pitching in the same direction
and advancing one beyond the other. It is not unnatural to suppose that a
similar feature may be found on a larger scale in great mountain ranges, and on
this view the Teram Kangri and Gasherbrum peaks would fall into the same range,
continued probably to K^2^ and the Mustagh Peaks. Nor would the interruption of
the range by the deep gap between Teram Kangri and Gasherbrum, or by the
Godwin-Austen glacier valley between that and K^2^, affect the structural unity
of the range, for it must be remembered that the peaks are peaks because the
agencies of denudation have not vet had time to remove them, though they have
removed all the surrounding rock: on the other hand the peaks owe their
elevation to the fact that the rock of which they are composed has been
uplifted, and where we find a group of peaks rising much above those by which
they are surrounded, we may conclude that this great elevation is due to the
fact that the last episode, in the general uplift of the mountains, was a more
rapid and greater upheaval of the particular region in which the high peaks are
found.

It might be, of course, that there were two neighbouring areas of such special
elevation, one marked by the Teram Kangri group of peaks, the other by the K^2^,
Broad, Gasherbrum and Hidden Peaks, and that between them lay a zone of lesser
uplift. A more probable case, however, is that these two groups of very high
peaks form parts of the same general area of special, recent, uplift, and this
special upheaval may have determined the position of the watershed, which
crosses the Oprang-Nubra trough. If this is the ease. K^2^ and the Mustagh Peaks
are restored to that group of ranges crossed by the Karakoram pass, which
together have come to be known as the Karakoram mountains.

That such widely divergent views of the classification of these mountains can be
put forward, without any possibility of even indicating which is likely to be
ultimately accepted, shows how little is really known as vet, and how much
remains to be done before the structure of this region can be rationally
discussed, much less said to be properly understood.

Srinagar, Skardu and Gilgit respectively was at 10 a.m. 497.15, 623.94, 575.15 and 631.66 millimetres, and at 4 p.m. 493.96, 619.90, 572.20 and 627.78 millimetres. Thus the pressure at 2 p.m. was presumably much higher than at 4 p.m. assumed for the calculations, and hence the altitude of the highest point reached is probably some 66 feet higher than the figure obtained. But this supplementary computation was not made, because it was a question of an isolated observation, and also because little was known of the daily variation of the pressure in those regions.]{.footnote}

[^2010]: [This word, which is not used in England or mentioned in English text books, is in common use by French and Italian geologists for a rock composed of small rounded fragments. or pebbles, of quartz scattered through a fine grained micaceous matrix. Rocks of this kind are common in the Alps, as also in parts of the Himalayas, and since there is no word in common English to describe them the term has been retained.—R. D. O.]{.footnote}

[^2022]: [The view of Bride Peak in the photographs, and the course of the boundary from the Chogolisa Pass along the whole of the lower part of the Godwin Austen glacier, seem to indicate a well-marked easterly or, more precisely, north-easterly dip. If this dip remained unaltered the boundary should rise along the base of K^2^ to the Savoia pass. That the boundary is found at Windy Gap, much further cast, indicates a stratigraphical disturbance, either fracture or secondary fold, causing either bodily displacement or a local change of dip, and determining the abrupt bend to the north-eastwards of the course of the upper Godwin-Austen glacier.]{.footnote}
