THE whole of our baggage had been sent off from Europe already divided into
packages of the right weight for coolies, and formed altogether 262 loads of
about 50 lbs. each. This made it possible to arrange the caravan quite easily
and without any waste of time from the very outset, in the early morning of
April 24th. Each of our ninetyfive ponies carried two or three of these loads,
and in a short time all were on the road. We did not follow until 9 o’clock,
after taking leave of our courteous hosts. Sir Francis and Lady Younghusband.

Now at last the real journey had begun—the camp life that brings one into the
close communion with nature so good for body and mind. Walking is really the
only kind of locomotion that puts us on equal terms with the world about us. Our
modern mechanical methods of transportation tend to make us lose sight of our
relative importance. The first stage of our journey was only 12 miles, and ran
along the nearly level bottom of the Sind valley, over a wide path between
blossoming trees and cultivated fields. Near the mouth of the valley, on the
left side, runs for some distance a high ledge, similar to those we had noticed
in the Jhelum valley, but in this case formed by fluvio-glacial deposits. The
opposite side of the valley is formed by the southern spurs of Haramuk.

![THE CAMP AT KANGAN.](Karakoram_050.jpg "THE CAMP AT KANGAN."){#b050}
::::

The main trend of the Sind valley^[^0400]^ is from west to east. The left side, which
faces north, is steep and almost entirely clothed with forests. The other side,
which the path mainly follows, slopes somewhat more gently, and is treeless,
except for the strip of cultivation at the bottom, above which pastures reach up
to the foot of the rocks. The limitation of the forests to the slopes which face
the north is universal throughout the region, and has been noticed by many
travellers. It is probably due to the fact that the snows lies longer on the
northern slopes, and thus give a greater degree of moisture. This holds good
even on the sides of the wide plateau of Kashmir, where the slopes of the Pir
Panjal range which face northwards are clothed with forests, whereas the slopes
of the Himalaya which bound the plain to the north are nearly treeless.

Soon after midday we made our stage at a place called Kangan.^[^0401]^ Here we found the
equipment already deposited in a level field surrounded by large walnut trees,
where our tents were not long in setting up. We were still on the Kashmir side
of the water-shed, so, as usual in the afternoon, a storm blew up, and it rained
until nightfall.

After Kangan the path began to climb more rapidly, and the scenery assumed a more
Alpine aspect. The ground on the left side of the valley was covered with snow,
which showed between the firs and pines, and, as our way ascended, reached down
nearer and nearer to the bottom of the valley. There were no more chenars, but
their place was taken by splendid walnut trees, with parasitic orchids growing
on the branches. The commonest tree is the willow.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![THE CAMP AT GUND.](Karakoram_051.jpg "THE CAMP AT GUND."){#b051}
::::

All this part of the valley shows clear traces of glacial action.^[^0403]^ The whole of
the Sind valley was at one time filled by a glacier more than 30 miles long,
about the size of the present great glaciers of the Karakoram. To-day there are
only a number of small shrunken glaciers in the upper reaches of the tributary
valleys. Oestreich has counted thirty-three of them.

Our next stage brought us to Gund, a village standing rather high on the right
bank of the Sind river, 13 miles from Kangan. Here we left our ponies behind, as
a little farther up the valley was still full of snow, and everything would have
to be carried by coolies. These coolies had gathered at Gund from all the
villages in the valley—in fact, during the morning’s march we had passed numbers
of them on their way up. There were over 250 of them, squatting or lying in
groups on the ground or wandering around the camp, which they greatly enlivened
by their presence. They were all Kashmiris, with bronzed faces and European
features, now and then markedly Semitic in type. They had black hair and flowing
beards, and wore garments of puttoo, the coarse country home-spun, with short
wide breeches and a sort of coat with ample sleeves that reaches down to a
little above the knee. Over the coat they wear a woollen blanket shawl like a
shepherd’s plaid, wound round the waist or over the back. Their headgear
consists of a sort of skull cap, round which is twisted turbanwise a narrow
strip of white cotton cloth which has attained an indefinable shade between
dirty white and grey. Their feet are clad in sandals of plaited straw, which
they make for themselves in spare moments and throw away by the roadside when
worn out. Their legs are either bare or covered with puttees.

All the coolies were incessantly interfered with, worried and kept In a state of
perpetual excitement by the numerous official escort which was directing the
management of the caravan. I will here devote a few words to this official
escort, its relative importance and usual relations with the traveller.

All strangers travelling in the domains of the Maharajah, whether for
exploration, for sport or for mere pleasure, must be provided with an official
permit or perwanna, which is supplied by the administrative authorities of each
district. This paper authorizes the traveller to demand from the village
headmen, with or without the intervention of higher officials, the necessary
supplies of coolies, saddles, luggage ponies, provisions, wood, etc., at the
legal tariff prices, which are always specified upon a list posted up at the
dak-bungalows.

At the top of the official tree stands the Tehsildar, who is a real prefect,
with fiscal functions, and who superintends the whole district or *tehsil*. He
is usually selected from the official employés who have been trained in the
Government schools of India and possess a certain degree of culture and at least
a slight acquaintance with the English language. Under him there may be a
Naib-Tehsildar, ruling subdistricts. Tehsildars and Naib-Tehsildars, like all
the employés of the Central Government of Kashmir, are invanably Hindu. The
heads of the villages are the Zaildars or Lambardars. The police service is
managed by the Jemadars and their subordinates the Chuprassis, whose duty it is
also to enforce the observation of the forest and game laws.

Some districts are still under a Rajah, who is seldom, however, a descendant of
the families that ruled the country before the conquest, these having been
nearly all deprived of their power. The office is hereditary. They govern
through a Wazir or minister, but they are subject to the suzerainty of the
Maharajah, and in fiscal matters are answerable to the Tehsildar.

The traveller usually brings with him a Shikari, who treats on his behalf with
the Jemadar and with the Zaildar or Lambardar, and notifies these officials of
the requirements of the party. The Shikari is likewise responsible for
discipline and order among the coolies, pony drivers, etc., and upon hint depend
mainly the relations between the traveller and the natives. The majority of the
Europeans who travel in the dominions of Kashmir come purely for sport, so the
Shikari is usually a man familiar with the country from the point of view of
game. He knows the best *nullahs* and the habits of the bears, leopards, ibexes,
markhor, *oris poli* and other wild animals which inhabit the western Himalaya.
Our Shikari Abdullah had gone on before, and was already at Dras with Mr.
Baines, so we did the first part of the journey without him. We did not miss
him, as the expedition was accompanied the whole way up the Sind valley by the
escort, which comprised all the categories of functionaries I have just
mentioned. There was a general superintendent, Baboo Fagir Mohamed, who was
intelligent, silent and had very great authority. There was the Naib-Tehsildar
Munshi Ghullam Haider Khan, a sort of ferocious-looking Othello in a fanciful
jacket of olive-green with cuffs and collar of fur, which made him look rather
like a lion tamer at a fair. The interpreter was a fat giant with bloodshot eyes
and an apoplectic face with a fringe of beard dyed with henna. There was a
Jemadar or police official, and under his orders were five Chuprassis, in
addition to the Zaildar of Gunderbal and the Lambardars of the villages from
which the coolies came.

The chief officials took their orders from the Duke and transmitted them in
regular hierarchical order. In spite of these complicated arrangements the
functions of the caravan were carried out with great regularity and precision
and perfect discipline.

![THE MONEY KILTAS AND PAYING THE COOLIES.](Karakoram_052.jpg "THE MONEY KILTAS AND PAYING THE COOLIES."){#b052}
::::

The day was cloudy and cool, with a few intervals of hot sunshine. The afternoon
was laborious. We had to pay and dismiss the pony drivers who had come from
Gunderbal—two stages at half a rupee per stage and per horse. The intermediaries
are so numerous that the best policy is to pay the coolies direct in person and
one by one. This system is being generally adopted by European travellers. who
used to trust to the Tehsildar or Lambardar to divide the sum between the men.
The Duke had decided to follow the method adopted by the
Eckenstein-Pfannl-Guillarmod expedition, of giving each coolie a numbered metal
counter, which he has to hand in against his wages. This enabled the payments to
proceed rapidly, and made the supervision simple and easy. The chief drawback
was the necessity of carrying an immense weight of money divided into single
rupees and fractions of rupees. Our small change occupied nine kiltas and
weighed over 450 lbs.

The Duke always superintended the arranging and counting of the luggage: 171
packages were distributed among the same number of coolies, who left at once so
as to divide the party and make its movements quicker. As each coolie passes
with his load he receives his numbered counter. All round us stands the crowd of
those who are waiting for their turn, Some of them seem to be about seventy
years old, and some who really look too old for work we are obliged to set
aside. And yet these men, in addition to their 50 or 55 Ib. load, carry in skin
bag their own food for the whole journey from here to Dras and back—at least
another 22 lbs. of rice or flour. This makes a total of 75 or 80 lbs. to be
carried through the snow over the Zoji La.

The great number of volunteers who rushed to the spot is to be explained by the
extraordinary wages of a whole rupee a day, which the Kashmir Government allows
coolies for crossing the Zoji La in the winter or spring, a wage intended as a
compensation for the danger of avalanches and the fatigue of walking through the
deep snow instead of on an easy path as in summer. The usual tariff is from 4 to
6 annas a day—from *4d.* to *6d.*—without food.

The loads, kiltas, boxes of provisions, sleeping-bags, bundles, of tents,
camp-beds, etc., are placed upon primitive carrying devices, which consist of
four upright poles fixed to the corners of a narrow rectangular base. Two ropes
serve to fasten it over the shoulders. The coolie’s step is elastic and quick,
even up-hill. He makes short halts to get his breath, more or less often
according to the difficulties of the road. During these brief halts he lifts his
load off his back, resting it on a sort of crutch formed by a short pole,
furnished at the top with a wide flat support and at the bottom with a broad
wooden foot, in order that it may not sink in the soil.

After the daily storm comes the usual clear evening. By half-past eight the
whole camp is at rest. Near the kiltas which contain the treasury of small
change the chuprassi on guard watches in solitude, squatting on his heels before
a few smouldering sticks and well wrapped up in his woollen plaid. The roar of
the torrent comes up from far below. Eastward the valley rises steep and
straight, then suddenly disappears from sight behind a spur. The slopes above us
glitter with snow. We feel that we are at the gates of the mountain.

The following days were an interlude of high mountain life between the green
garden of Kashmir and the parched and torrid valleys of the  Indus basin. From
Gund onward the caravan consisted of over 270 persons, counting the officials,
coolies and servants. 171 coolies had left Gund on the day of our arrival, and
100 remained with us.

![THE SIND VALLEY BEYOND GUND.](Karakoram_056.jpg "THE SIND VALLEY BEYOND GUND."){#b056}
::::

For a few hours the path led as before between willows and fruit trees, mingled
with fir and pine. But now, little by little, the ascent becomes steeper, and
the mountains draw near and become more precipitous. The springlike aspect of
the valley disappears to make way for a winter scene. At the foot of each
lateral gully or ravine the accumulations of snow become wider and more
frequent. Next the valley is cut across by a great step at the gorge of
Gagangir, which is piled up with boulders. Here the torrent dashes wildly to the
bottom of the gorge, where it is hidden by vast snow avalanches, which bridge it
over often 10 or 20 feet deep, and which here and there are covered with fresh
avalanches fallen, a few days before, and not yet flattened by melting or
blackened with dust. The road now passes high up on the right flank of the
valley, through a little wood of deciduous trees, whose buds are just beginning
to swell, though the path is quite hidden away under snow. On our march we are
surprised at passing some of the coolies whom we had thought it our duty to
reject on the preceding day because they looked to be about 100 years old. The
poor old fellows must have bought back the engagement from the younger men we
had selected in their places, and thus thwarted our intentions.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![THE GORGE OF GAGANGIR.](Karakoram_057.jpg "THE GORGE OF GAGANGIR."){#b057}
::::

From the gorge of Gagangir we come out upon a small level and cross the Sind
valley to the left bank. We then climb over the ridge of a moraine formation
clothed with conifers and reach the wide plateau of Sonamarg, which is treeless
and covered with a layer of hard snow about three feet deep.^[^0404]^ The plateau is
nearly two miles broad, and at the upper end stands the Sonamarg bungalow^[^0405]^, about
14½ miles from Gund. We have now reached a height of 8,763 feet. The sky had
been overclouded all day, and it now began to rain. The temperature was only 41° F.
Little glaciers were just visible through the mist on the left of the valley,
the lower part of which was clothed with pine woods. It was a characteristic
Alpine winter scene, sad, monotonous and grey, with a rainy atmosphere melting
into the snow of the plain. It seemed incredible that before many weeks passed
the place would turn into a great green meadow starred with golden crocus, and
with the fringe of the surrounding forest dotted with the camps of English
people, whom the heat of the Kashmir summer drives up into the cooler air.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![THE SIND VALLEY BETWEEN SONAMARG AND BALTAL.](Karakoram_058.jpg "THE SIND VALLEY BETWEEN SONAMARG AND BALTAL."){#b058}
::::

We took refuge in the bungalow, consisting of a square courtyard full of
trampled snow and mud, on three sides of which runs a verandah, on which open
the doors of the sleeping rooms. Two of these are empty and reserved for
Europeans, and here we spread our camp-beds. The others are filthy barracks for
the use of the coolies.

Shortly after our arrival the 171 coolies who formed the first detachment began
to pass through. They had spent the night halfway between Gund and Sonamarg, and
were now going on to Baltal. Next came dropping in in small detachments the
coolies who marched with us. The courtyard and verandah were soon filled with
them. They formed groups around the fires which they lighted here and there in
the mud, under kettles where the tea was boiling, in which they soak   their
small loaves or chupattis. They are wondertully dirty and very good-natured
looking, and they smile at us in a friendly way.

The Sonamarg bungalow lies on the left bank of the Sind River, On the right bank
beyond the bridge stands the tiny village, the highest in the whole valley.
There is a small house for the post and one for the telegraph. Close by is the
meteorological station, which is supphed with a few instruments. There are also
three or four huts built of tree trunks, all crooked and apparently on the point
of tumbling to pieces. The place seems almost deserted, and it is a surprise to
us to find plenty of fresh milk, sheep, fowls, and eggs, which provisions we
shall continue to find, with but few exceptions, at each stage of our march
through the valleys. This fresh food forms the basis of our diet, which is
completed by our provision tins, containing ship’s biscuit, butter, soups,
vegetables, fruits, coffee, tea, sugar, condiments, etc.

The meteorological office in these remote stations is usually entrusted to the
telegraph clerk, who takes the observations twice a day. We were greatly
interested in collecting the data of these little Alpine stations, they being
necessary to calculate the observations to be taken by the expedition later on,
in the high mountains. It was very desirable to have the observations taken
three times a day, so as to get a greater probability of their being at the same
time as ours. The Duke therefore arranged with the telegraph official to read
the meteorological instruments daily at 8 and 10 o’clock in the morning and at 4
o’clock in the afternoon from that day to the end of August. Similar
arrangements were made at the meteorological stations of Srinagar, Gilgit, Leh
and Skardu.

On the morning of April 27th we accomplished the short stage from Sonamarg to
Baltal, which is at the foot of the Zoji La, ma melancholy fine rain with a low
mist, which completely shut out the slopes and peaks. This stage is only 9 miles
over a good track, well beaten in the snow. The path leads now high on the right
side of the Sind valley, where the orange-yellow crocuses (*Colchicum luteum
Bak.*) have already come pluckily into blossom wherever a bit of land is bare of
snow; and again, along the bottom of the valley through little groves of pine,
fir and birch. We keep overtaking and passing groups of coolies who left
Sonamarg before us; but we ourselves are caught up with and left behind by the
dak-wallah, who runs up-hill over the snow, carrying the postbag and his own
blankets and food, with his whole body and mind bent on the exertion, so great a
one that it hardly seems possible he can go on for more than a few minutes. He
is armed with a spear with a shrill-tongued bell tied to the shaft, to frighten
away wild animals. By relays of these dak runners the weekly post goes all the
way from Srinagar to Leh and Skardu, covering on an average some 30 miles a day.

![NEAR BALTAL.](Karakoram_060.jpg "NEAR BALTAL."){#b060}
::::

Except for this lonely wayfarer our expedition was quite alone in the high
valley of the Sind. Once the snow is gone, there is a ceaseless coming and going
of caravans of Baltis, Ladakhis, Tartars from Chinese Turkestan and Tibetans,
often accompanied by their wives, their flocks und their herds, and leading
horses or yaks laden with merchandise, crossing and recrossing the Himalaya over
this, the only trade route between Tibet and Kashgar on one side and Kashmir,
Afghanistan and Persia on the other.

Baltal^[^0407]^ stands 9,258 feet above the sea level^[^0406]^ at the foot of a perpendicular
spur of the Kanipatri group, which dominates the Zoji La to the south. Here the
Sind valley bifurcates. The greater branch, through which the Panjtarni torrent
flows, runs south-east; the other is a short, steep gorge, which leads to the
pass and carries on the general trend of the Sind valley towards the cast. Both
are deep gorges with precipitous sides much broken up by landslides. In the
angle formed by the meeting-place of the Panjtarmi torrent with the stream that
comes down from the Zoji La, is a small plateau with a grove of sycamores,
birches, poplar and willow trees, mingled with several sorts of conifers.
Here stands a new, roomy bungalow, where caravans can dwell at ease, to give
time to the new-fallen snow either to be hardened by frost or to fall in
avalanches, before attempting the dangerous pass.

Mr. Baines had sent thirty Balti coolies from Dras to meet us, under the
guidance of the head Shikari Abdullah, so as to beat the path over the snow on
the hills and to help our Kashmiris with the loads. Thus there were over 300
coolies gathered at Baltal and lodged partly in huts around the bungalow and
partly in the old bungalow on the other bank of the torrent. They were all very
busy plaiting themselves straw shoes. From Sonamarg onward the Duke had smoked
spectacles distributed among those of the coolies who appeared to suffer from
the reverberation of the snow. We reviewed them again one by one, and about half
of them were provided with dark glasses for the journey of the morrow.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![THE BUNGALOW AT BALTAL.](Karakoram_061.jpg "THE BUNGALOW AT BALTAL."){#b061}
::::

All through the afternoon showers of fine snow kent falling like waterfalls off
the rocky spur of Kanipatri in the rear of the bungalow. In the clear evening
light we could distinguish the deep walls of the valleys furrowed with gullies
and chimneys between sharp ridges ending in spires, aiguilles and peaks, covered
with virgin snow. From the Panjtarni valley a dizzy ridge leads up to the fine
peak of Ambarnath, above 17,000 feet in height. It all seemed quite
inaccessible, but it  must look very different in the summertime. Later in the
evening a great landslide fell from a considerable height from the wall of the
Zoji La valley, and hurled itself down with a thundering sound, rolling down
earth, stones and snow, which spread out in a gigantic fan, covering the path up
to the pass for a long distance. The mountain wall above is left scarred by a
wide gash that stands out conspicuous amid the spotless snows surrounding it.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![THE MOUTH OF THE ZOJI LA.](Karakoram_062.jpg "THE MOUTH OF THE ZOJI LA."){#b062}
::::

We went to bed for a few hours only, for the ascent must be made before the sun
rises to melt the bonds of frost which hold the snow fast upon the slopes.
