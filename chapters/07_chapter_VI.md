FOUR days’ march through valleys and over mountains still buried in winter snow
had brought us to the bare and arid basm of the river Dras. The wintry interlude
had almost made us forget the fascinating spectacle of the vale of Kashmir in
its spring blossom and thus the edge was taken off from the surprising contrast
between two regions so wholly diverse from each other. They feel this contrast
more keenly who cross the Zoji La in summer gazing to the very top of the pass
upon the green forests and rich pastures of the Sind valley, and then looking
down on the other side upon the stony desert of Baltistan. There is probably no
other range of mountains upon the face of the earth whose two slopes reveal
features so absolutely opposed to one another. The traveller has crossed the
great northern barrier of India, and has suddenly entered a country which is
physically identical with Tibet and Central Asia.

Padre Ippolito Desideri^[^0601]^, an Italian missionary who crossed the Zoji La on May
30th. 1715, describes the trans-Himalayan region in the following words: “From
the foot of this pass throughout the whole extent of the nine months’ march that
it takes to get from here to China,  there is no fertility, no greenness or
pleasantness in the land, nothing but the absolute and horrible desolation of
the Caucasian mountains, which stretch all that way and which the geographers
call ”*dorsum orbis*.”^[^0602]^ Padre Desideri went no farther than Leh, which is only
fourteen or fifteen marches from Zoji La; but the “horrible desolation” of the
mountains stretches over the whole of Baltistan and the neighbouring countries
of Gilgit and Astor to the west and Ladakh to the south-east—in other words,
the whole of the region lying to the north of the western Himalaya.

It is an enormous strip, over 300 miles broad, all of it above 7,000 feet high,
and it seems distorted by a fearful convulsion of the earth’s surface. It is
covered by a complicated system of mountain ranges, with peaks from 26.000 to
28.000 feet high, and includes immense plateaus from 46 to 60 miles wide and
from 15,000 to 17,000 feet above sea level, as well as innumerable valleys and
countless glaciers, some of which are over 40 miles long.

The whole of this vast region is quite bare and without vegetation. Few and far
between are the groups of trees or bushes, the little grassy hollows hidden away
in the high valleys, or the small oases laboriously created by the diligence of
the natives. They are all too diminutive to appear as more than dots in the
illimitable desert of rock, gravel and sand. No doubt the lack of moisture in
the atmosphere is the cause of this extraordinary barrenness. The wall of the
Himalayan range stops and condenses on its southern side nearly the whole of the
moisture which the monsoon brings from the south-west, thus giving rise to the
startling contrast between the atmospheric precipitation of the two slopes.
Hence the singular phenomenon of the far lower snowlevel and the far lower point
reached by the glaciers on the southern slopes of the chain than on the northern
slopes, notwithstanding the higher temperature and the greater rapidity of
melting brought about by the southern exposure.^[^0603]^ And not only is there such a
contrast between the southern and northern exposure on the main ridge, but the
further you go behind the Himalaya the higher is the limit of the glaciers.^[^0604]^ The
dryness of the climate is such that in the whole of the trans-Himalayan region
there are barely six inches of rainfall in the year. Were it a plain it would be
like the Sahara. Fortunately. however, the highest ridges condense into snow
whatever moisture escapes being caught upon the Himalaya, so that, whenever the
exposure and the slope of the mountains allow it, nevés and glaciers are formed
which permit the scanty population to support life in spite of their inhuman
surroundings.

The climate is always extreme. The winter is so severe that torrents and rivers
are covered with a thick layer of ice and form excellent roads, far better than
the primitive paths which wind along the mountain sides. In summer the sun
blazes with intolerable violence through the dry atmosphere, though the
temperature is by no means excessive. The nights are very cool.

A single valley of vast length winds in deep serpentine curves through the
ranges and forms a connecting link among the chaos of valleys—the high valley of
the Indus, which runs through the whole region, with a main trend from
south-west to north-east, at a height of from 7.000 to 10.000 feet gathering
every torrent, every brook, every river that flows down from the springs, the
snows and the glaciers throughout the whole vast extent of the region.

Thus we have the singular fact that the chain of the Himalaya is not a
water-shed. Kashmir to the south-west. Baltistan and_ its neighbouring provinces
to the north-east, all belong to the same hydrographic basin, that of the Indus.
This lack of relation between the orographie and the hydrographic scheme is a
feature common to the whole Himalaya. In other words. the Indus, the Bramaputra,
and, in fact, most of the great rivers of India, have their sources north of the
great chains, through which they cut their way in gorges which are the grandest
in the world. Between one range and another they flow through long stretches of
the intervening longitudinal valleys, descending gradually from one to the next
until they reach the plain of India. The Indus, between its sources in Tibet and
its outlet into the Indian plain,  flows some 1,100 miles between range and
range of the western Himalaya, with a total drop of 16,000 feet and an average
drop of less than three per 1,000.

Geologists have laboured to find an explanation of this seemingly paradoxical
phenomenon—namely, that the course of the rivers is not determined by the
mountain ranges. They usually base their theories upon the geological fact that
the chain of the Himalaya is a comparatively recent formation. The whole
formidable upheaval which has created the most gigantic bastion on the face of
the earth appears to have commenced only in the latter part of the tertiary
period, and many are of opinion that it is still going on. This upheaval has
been neither so swift nor so violent as to alter the main lines of surface
drainage which were already in existence. The Himalayan rivers of our time may
therefore represent the ancient hydrographic system, which flowed from north to
south, having preserved their course by a process of gradual erosion of their
beds progressing contemporaneously with the upheaval of the ranges between their
sources and the Indian plain. In this way the valleys would have grown gradually
deeper while their side-walls were rearing themselves up to the immense height
which they have attained. This is the theory of H. B. Medlicott and of
Richthofen.^[^0605]^ The upheaval would have taken place in a series of long parallel
folds, giving rise to the longitudinal valleys.

R. D. Oldham has further suggested another special form of erosion to explain
the formation of certain cross valleys. He is of opinion that a torrent by
progressive erosion of its bed can eat away the bottom of the gorge in which it
runs to such a depth as gradually to cut actually through the chain.^[^0606]^ This
process would go on with greater activity in the gorges of the southern slopes
of the mountains than in those on the northern slopes, on account of the greater
volume of water, owing to the higher degree of atmospheric precipitation, Once
the chain was quite cut through the waters of the valley lying to the north of
the chain, at right angles to the newly-formed channel, would flow down   into
the southern valley, which is always the lower of the two. In this way the
southern water courses would have gradually captured the northern waters.

This brief account will suffice to show that the whole system of Himalayan
orohydrography is not a single conception subdivided into two branches depending
one upon the other, as is the case in the other mountainous regions known to us.
On the contrary, it consists of two absolutely different systems. Hence any
description of this region or classification of its features, or even
cartography, may, as has been clearly demonstrated by Burrard, be done according
to either of two alternative plans, starting either from the hydrographic or the
orographic system. This dualism has caused considerable uncertainty and
confusion, because most of those who have described this region have based their
description indiscriminately now upon the orographic and again upon the
hydrographic data, without any definite plan. Burrard, on the contrary, begins
with a description of the orographic morphology. giving the scheme of the ranges
without taking into account the watercourses; and then he begins over again to
describe the same region according to the hydrographic basins and the river
courses.

In this state of uncertainty of the whole question it is possible that in the
future geology may give the key to a rational classification of the mountains.
The observations made by the Italian expedition and by the Longstaff expedition
in the same summer certainly showed that the geological structure of the high
ranges is far less uniform and simple than has been believed up till now.

The region to the north of the western Himalaya comprises districts which are
quite distinct from one another, not merely owing to political frontiers, but
because of differences in the anthropological types, religions and customs of
their inhabitants. South-westward, wedged between Baltistan, Tibet and Kashmir,
hes Ladakh, which is in no wise distinguishable from Tibet, of which it was a
province prior to the Sikh conquest. Its inhabitants, like the rest of the
Tibetans, are Mongols, professing Llamaism and practising polyandry. Bordering
upon Ladakh to the north-east lies Baltistan or Little Tibet, situated, roughly
speaking, between 34° to 36° N. Lat. and 75° to 77° E. Long., and inhabited by
Mohammedans of the Shiite sect.

Baltistan and Ladakh are both administered by a high functionary of Kashmir, the
Wazir-i-Wazarat, who is resident at Leh, and upon   whom depend two Tehsildars,
one at Kargil and the other at Skardu. The British Government is represented in
two districts by an English official, whose headquarters are at Leh, and who is
subordinate to the Resident of Kashmir. To the west of Baltistan are the
districts of Astor and Gilgit, which march with Afghanistan and are inhabited
Dards.

![THE DRAS VALLEY.](Karakoram_077.jpg "THE DRAS VALLEY."){#b077}
::::

Our route now descends the Dras valley to its meeting with the Indus, which
latter it follows across Baltistan as far as Skardu. The Dras and the Indus
together form a semi-circle giving a diameter of about 30 miles around a
gigantic centre of upheaval, the table-land of Deosai, 14,000 feet in altitude.
The distance from the village of Dras to the Indus is about 48 miles, with a
drop of less than 1,500 feet. For the first 33 miles the route to Skardu is
identical with the route to Leh, capital of Ladakh.

We left Dras early in the morning of April 30th. The great basin which feeds the
river is closed at the lower end by a sort of natural dam, through which the
water has cut an outlet. This obstruction crossed, we enter the Dras valley
proper, which is at first wide and open, with a round and level bottom, but
lower down becomes narrower and gradually puts on the V-shape. In fact, the
valleys of the western Himalaya are characteristically much narrower and more
shut in in their lower than their upper course. This feature was very clearly
marked in the Gumber valley, which we had just come down. Perhaps the round
bottom of the upper part is a sign that the high valley was occupied by glaciers
in the past, while the pointed bottom of the lower part suggests the outlet cut
by erosion of the river. This hypothesis ought, however, to be supported by
geological data, which would require a search for specific glacier marks.

Throughout its whole length the valley is encumbered by huge fanshaped alluvial
deposits or cones of detritus, which mark the mouth of every tributary gorge.
and in the intervals between these by immense asses of detritus, which fill the
valley bottom and come down in steep falls from a considerable height on the
mountain side. There is detritus of every size, from fine sand to blocks of
several cubic yards, composed of granite of varying texture and of colour
ranging from light grey to nearly black. Although still at low water the stream
runs fiercely, and its muddy ashen-grey waters rage in foaming eddies through
the generally deep and narrow bed which it has eaten out through a layer of
detritus often many yards deep. All these phenomena we shall see repeated on a
far greater scale in the Indus valley.

The whole country is barren, without a blade of grass. Only among the stones
along the river grow a few very thorny brambles not yet beginning to bud, and a
few isolated juniper bushes—*Juniperus excelsa*—the only woody growth of all
these desolate shores except where there is artificial cultivation. It assumes
such a twisted, stunted and contorted aspect as scarcely to deserve the name of
tree, even when it has a thick trunk of many years’ standing and numerous
branches.

The valley runs eastward at first for 7 or 8 miles, and then turns
north-eastward. Some 14 miles from Dras the path leaves the left side of the
valley and crosses the river over a bridge built in two sections, resting on a
big boulder in the middle of the stream, and not inspiring great confidence by
its appearance. We crossed it leading our ponies over the beams, which shook and
groaned under the weight.

The long day's march ended at Karbu bungalow, 21 miles from Dras, in a narrow
gorge of the valley. Beyond the brawling torrent, on the rocks of the steep left
side of the valley, were a troop of ibexes,  which the Shikari Abdullah followed
with hungry eyes, pointing them out to us for several hours. All this upper part
of the Dras valley, as far as the place where the road to Leh branches off, is
inhabited by a mixed population, Among the coolies engaged at Dras and the
people we met on the road and in the villages and fields, the marked Mongol
types were numerous and perhaps in the majority, with their slanting eyes,
projecting cheek bones and hairless faces or thin, bristly beards.

They had not the long pigtails of the Ladakhi, but they had preserved many of
his special forms of dress—the long coats open at the sides, the caps with their
large brim cut away on the forehead and turned up at the temples; the socks of
thick cloth or white felt, into which are gathered the ends of the wide
trousers: and even here and there a bine quilted coat. No doubt the cold of the
high valley has influenced these descendants of Tibetans to preserve the
garments which are suited to their freezing plateaus, whereas the mixture with
the Baltis and Kashmiris has made them forego other ethnological traits of
purely ornamental value, such as the pigtail.

::::

The haste of our journey, our incomplete preparation and our ignorance of the
language prevented us from gathering more detailed particulars. It is certain,
as we shall see presently, that the real Baltis show very different
anthropological features. I have no doubt that this predominance of Ladakhi
traits in the upper Dras valley, forming as it does the first impression of the
traveller who comes from Kashmir to Baltistan, has had its weight in the growth
of the widely-spread opinion that the Baltis are little, if at all, different
from the Ladakhis.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![KARBU BUNGALOW.](Karakoram_080.jpg "KARBU BUNGALOW."){#b080}
::::

As for the villages through which we pass after leaving Dras, they are not only
not to be compared with the prosperous and solidly-built habitations of the
Ladakhis, but not even to the inferior villages of lower Baltistan. These Dras
valley dwellings were tumble-down hovels some six feet high, with walls built of
stones ill put together, and a flat roof of beaten earth, upon which four flat
stones are placed with their edges leaning one upon the next around the hole
which serves as a chimney. There are no windows, and only a low hole for a door.
Inside there is barely room to stand upright. The wretched appearance of the
inhabitants matches the squalor of their dwelling-houses, and is increased by
their dirtiness, which is absolutely unimaginable. The domestic animals are
small in size like the people, and share in the general misery. The ponies have
long shaggy hair, and are as thin as skeletons, with hydropic paunches and
knotty legs. The full-grown sheep and goats seem only half developed. The cattle
are partly of  the humped Indian kind, and partly hybrids between these and the
yak, known as *zho*. The cows are small, lean and ill-shaped; the calves are
pitiful. The hard Hindu law enforced upon these Mohammedans forbids under severe
penalties the slaughter of cattle. Therefore the calves are weaned before their
time so as to continue to profit by the milk of the cow, and they may be seen
trying to browse upon the lean vegetation, pitifully staggering upon little legs
as vet scarcely strong enough to carry them.

In the fields around the villages ragged peasants follow primitive ploughs drawn
by oxen. Behind comes the woman, breaking up the clods with a small mattock. She
is covered with a pile of unspeakable rags, her face is hidden under a veritable
layer of dirt, her head is covered with a cloth, and she wears great earrings in
her ears. None of them wears the characteristic headgear set with turquoises and
silver ornaments which adorns the head and falls down upon the back of the women
of Ladakh. They seem more careless of the presence of the stranger than the
women of the Indus.

Not far from Karbu the Dras receives from the left an important confluent, the
Shigar, not to be confounded with the other river of the same name which falls
into the Indus near Skardu.^[^0607]^ This tributary of the Dras comes down from the
Deosai plain. On the return journey we crossed its sources.

Little by little the last traces of snow, which higher up occasionally lay along
the road on the fringe of the avalanches, disappear altogether and the scene
becomes even more barren and desolate, for the snow had seemed like a
justification of the absence of vegetation. The right bank of the valley, which
the path follows, is absolutely bare and parched. On the other side we saw
several little cultivated oases, As we descend further the ploughing gives way
to the sowing. and the fruit trees are putting forth their first blossom. Here
and there shapeless holes hollowed out in the alluvial deposit mark the passage
of goldseekers, whose labours must have been unrewarded, for the works are
utterly abandoned. Near the path we observe primitive shelters—plain rough
roofs, covering over some natural hollow of the earth and forming a sort of den,
neither high enough to stand nor wide enough to lie in. They suffice, however,
for the Baltis, who are in the habit of sleeping in a squatting posture, with
the head resting on the knees.

About eight miles from Karbu, at the outlet of a narrow gorge of the valley, we
see before us to our great surprise the incredible apparition of a real
suspension bridge, built according to rule, with high pillars of masonry
supporting the sustaining cables, over 200 feet long and 10 feet wide. This
piece of modern engineering stands in singular contrast to the stony desert and
the primitive roadway.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![PLOUGHING IN BALTISTAN.](Karakoram_082.jpg "PLOUGHING IN BALTISTAN."){#b082}
::::

The bridge marks an important bifurcation of the road. To go to Skardu you cross
the bridge. The other path continues along the right hand of the Dras to its
meeting with the Suru not far off, and then proceeds along the latter river to
Kargil, whence, after crossing various ridges, it reaches the Indus valley at a
higher point, and follows it up to Leh, the capital of Ladakh.

Immediately beyond the bridge, on a sandy alluvial level encircled in a wide
bend of the river, stands the bungalow of Karal, very primitive and too small to
house the expedition. We therefore set up our tents around it, tying the ropes
to big stones, for the pickets would not hold  in the deep sand. The great tent
of the Tehsildar of Kargil, Pandit Sri, who escorted the Duke from Dras onward,
seemed like a palace in comparison with ours. It consisted of a big square
central chamber, over which was stretched a fly, a sort of immense second roof,
which came down to the ground, forming two other little rooms on each side of
the centre one. Inside the ground was covered with rugs, and there were tables,
chairs, etc., a simple but convenient outfit. Hardly had we set up our camp when
a violent wind arose, whirling clouds of sand, which filled our noses, mouths
and eyes, and lay in a thick layer over everything. The tents flapped furiously
in the wind, and offered no protection against the fine dust, which penetrated
our clothes, beds and boxes. This was the first of a whole series of dry storms
which raged nearly every afternoon. They generally lasted three or four hours
and ceased toward evening.

:::: { .wrap-60 }
![AN OASIS IN THE DRAS VALLEY.](Karakoram_083.jpg "AN OASIS IN THE DRAS VALLEY."){#b083}
::::

Almost opposite the camp the Dras was Joined by the Surn, a large river which
flows from the south, bringing the waters produced by the melting of the
glaciers of the Nun Kun. Oestreich rightly observes that it would be more
correct to regard the Dras as a confluent of the Suru.

A ragged, wretched, sickly-looking crowd was gathered upon the rocks, and gazing
at us quite motionless. Perhaps they came from some village nestled high up
among the neighbouring rocks, or possibly from Karkitchu, the big village on the
opposite bank of the Dras. We paid and dismissed the ponies which we had brought
from Dras; and fifty-eight others, come we knew not whence, were immediately
loaded and sent on before.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![OUR CAMP UNDER THE APRICOTS AT OLTHINGTHANG.](Karakoram_084.jpg "OUR CAMP UNDER THE APRICOTS AT OLTHINGTHANG."){#b084}
::::

All through the night we heard our coolies coughing as they squatted round the
camp, ill-protected by their wretched woollens from the cold, which went down to
42° F. Next morning we found them still squatting in a circle at a respectful
distance from the tents, in the same posture in which we had left them the
evening before. Perhaps they had spent the whole night without moving. We had to
enlist thirty-eight extra coolies, as only twenty-one ponies were available.

:::: { .wrap-70 .break-before }
![At Olthingthang.](Karakoram_085.jpg "At Olthingthang."){#b085}
::::

The valley, as it approaches its end, grows so narrow that there is no room for
the path at the bottom, and it has to wind up and down the steep spurs. The
temperature had risen considerably, and the sun was hot even early in the
morning, so that our third stage in the Dras valley, though only 14 miles long,
was fatiguing enough. The path followed the left and steeper bank of the valley,
where there is no level ground suitable for cultivation. The opposite bank was
dotted with villages and gardens.

:::: { .wrap-80 }
![GROUP OF BOYS AT OLTHINGTHANG.](Karakoram_085a.jpg "GROUP OF BOYS AT OLTHINGTHANG."){#b085a}
::::

A short distance from the outlet of the valley, sloping down the sides of a spur
800 to 1,000 feet above the river, lies the big village of Olthingthang. We
passed through it up the steep stony path which winds through the oasis. The
houses have no upper story, and are built in the usual way with stones and mud.
They stand in groups among trees and fields, and distributed one behind another
up the slope, in such a way that the flat roof of the house below forms the
terrace on the ground level of the one above. These roof terraces were crowded
with swarms of children and their elders who watched the passing of the
expedition with lively comments.

The dak bungalow stood at the top of the village—dirty and primitive, and only
fit for coolies. But immediately above it was a semi-circular terrace, shaded by
the branches of two huge apricot trees in full bloom, beneath which ran a cool
brook. We set up our tents in the midst of this scene of blossoming spring.

:::: { .wrap-40 .float-left }
![NATIVES OF OLTHINGTHANG.](Karakoram_086.jpg "NATIVES OF OLTHINGTHANG."){#b086}
::::

In the course of the afternoon we proceeded to hold a dispensary and distribute
medical advice. The whole population of Olthingthang crowded thither, more to
enjoy the sight than to be healed. The crowd gathered in a sort of courtyard,
perhaps a house that had lost its roof, below the camp; and we had the sick
brought up one by one to the open space before the tents after a first summary
inquiry into their complaints. Mr, Baines translated my questions into Urdu for
the Shikari, and he repeated them in the Balti dialect to the patient. The
answers came back by the same devious course, so that I was obliged to put more
trust in the objective than the subjective symptoms of  disease. I was finally
consulted by the Rajah of Karmang—Aman Ali Shah—who was afflicted by a chronic
dermatitis of the hands, and who had come hither to pay his respects to the
Duke.

This medical review gave us our first opportunity of studying at close quarters
a great number of natives. The population was entirely Balti. and appeared to us
all to be indubitably and markedly Aryan in type. The Mongol types were the
exception, and could be distinguished at once by the marked contrast of their
features with those of the majority. This first impression was confirmed
throughout the journey, in the course of which we came into close contact with
thousands of Baltis in the process of engaging and paying off the coolies, in
the medical consultations, or among the crowds at the polo games and the
receptions given us by the Rajahs. I am unable to agree with the unanimous
opinion to the opposite effect on the part of all the English travellers who
have written about Baltistan.

![GROUP OF NATIVES FROM SHIGAR.](Karakoram_087.jpg "GROUP OF NATIVES FROM SHIGAR."){#b087}

Roero di Cortanze is the only one among the older writers who describes the
Baltis as “of the Caueasian or white race, in contradistinction to the Ladakhis,
who are Mongols and copper-coloured.” Vigne, one of the earliest visitors to the
region, puts them down as a mixed race, combining Mongol characteristics with
the nobler features of the Indian or Persian. Cunningham states explicitly that
they are a branch of the Mongol race, possessing its characteristics to a marked
degree, although sightly modified by climatic conditions and by mixture with the
Indo-Caucasians of India. Drew likewise assimilates them with the Ladakhis,
slightly modified by climatic influences; while Biddulph modifies the assertion
of their Tartar type by admitting a strong element of Aryan blood, owing to
mixture with the Dards. In the last edition of the *Gazetteer of India* the
Baltis are described as of common stock with the Ladakhis, and as Mongol in
feature. Even Dr. A. Neve, who lives in Kashmir and has been many times in
Baltistan, confirms the Tibetan origin of the inhabitants.^[^0608]^

![A CHUPRASSI FROM ASKOLEY IN THE BRALDOH VALLEY.](Karakoram_088.jpg "A CHUPRASSI FROM ASKOLEY IN THE BRALDOH VALLEY."){#b088}
::::

All these opinions are based solely upon ocular impression. Not one of these
authors has collected anthropological data to prove the asserted kinship of the
Baltis with the Ladakhis. If the reader will compare Cunninghamm’s description
with the comparative study of the Dards, Baltis and Ladakhis made by Ujfalvy,
the Hungarian anthropologist, at a more recent date and based upon scientific
methods of anthropomorphic investigation, he will be able to draw his own
conclusions as to the uncertainty of a mere description of the features as a
basis for racial classification. Cunningham asserts that, except for a few
individual cases in the upper classes, the Balti type is characteristically
Tartaro-Mongol, low in stature, face wide, flat and square, with projecting
cheekbones, narrow forehead, small, oblique, — slit-like eyes, broad flat nose
with wide nostrils, large, thick, projecting ears . with long lobes, large
mouth, and black, thick, usually curly hair. Ujfalvy, on the other hand,
describes them as clearly Aryan in type, of medium stature, low forehead, thick
and only slightly curved eyebrows, eyes set straight and close together,
cheekbones not projecting, nose long and straight, ears small and flat, mouth of
middle size with thick lips, chin oval, hair black, curly and abundant, beard
full, etc.^[^0609]^

The important point, however, is that Ujfalvy corroborates his statements with
anthropometric measurements. He collected his observations in Skardu, Shigar,
Parkutta, Kharmang, Olthingthang, Karkitchu and Dras, measuring also Baltis from
other places. He found that the Baltis had an average cephalic index^[^0610]^ of 72.35.
which is much nearer that of the Dards (73.62) than that of the Ladakhis (77).

I will not enter into any long repetition of figures, as I think the photographs
of natives reproduced in this volume and taken by Sella from the purely
artistic point of view, without any specific selection of types, are sufficient
to prove that the great majority of the Baltis correspond more to Ujfalvy’s
description than to Cunningham's.^[^0611]^

![GROUP FROM PARKUTTA IN THE INDUS VALLEY.](Karakoram_089.jpg "GROUP FROM PARKUTTA IN THE INDUS VALLEY."){#b089}

As to their origin, Ujfalvy considers them to be descendants of the ancient
Saci, who came from the north of the Tien Shan and mingled later with the
aborigines of Northern India, the Dards and the Tibetans. Biddulph quotes a
tradition which is still current in Skardu and Rondu, to the effect that,
Baltistan was first Inhabited by Dards of Aryan race, and later invaded by
Mongols, who became fused with the original population.

The Balti dialect is Tibetan, and this is their only common ground with the
Ladakhis. The difference in customs is fundamental. I have already mentioned that
the Ladakhis, like all Tibetans are Llamaists and practice polyandry, while the
Baltis are Mohammedans and polygamons. There can be no doubt as to the radical
difference in racial customs, ethics, family life and political institutions
springing from points of departure so diametrically opposed.

A very interesting point is the circumstance that the Baltis belong to the sect
of Shiite Mohammedans, whereas all the neighbouring peoples of Chinese
Turkestan, Kashmir and Dardistan belong to the Sunnite sect, like the rest of
Islam in India. The Baltis thus form a little island of Shiites surrounded on
every side by Sunnites, Hindus and Buddhists. Little is known as to the origin
of their religious traditions. Cunningham supposes that Islamism was introduced
among them in the first half of the thirteenth century. Drew is of opinion that
the four missionary brothers of Kurasan, to whom legend attributes the
conversion of Baltistan, must have been Shiites. The Brahminic bas-reliefs
carved upon great slabs of stone near Dras, as well as the religious
inscriptions and Buddhist symbols inscribed here and there upon the rocks along
the path, certainly prove that the Baltis have passed through the same religious
phases as the rest of northern India.

In addition to the Baltis proper, who form the bulk of the population, there are
in Baltistan small settlements of a people known as Brokpas, of Dard descent and
Buddhist religion, whose idiom, customs and caste are peculiar to themselves.
They are less civilized than the Baltis, who hold them in slight regard; and
they lead a primitive life, mainly as shepherds of the high valleys, where the
greater degree of moisture allows of a small extent of pasture. We did not come
into contact with any of them.

The indulgence of the reader will forgive this long digression, whose object has
been to make clear how little we know, and how uncertain is even that little, as
to the origin, history. tradition, legend and even ethnographical classification
of a population so interesting, and showing such clear signs of strong external
influence in the past, despite a geographical position so secluded, in a country
so wild and inhospitable that whole groups of villages are cut off from all
communion with the rest of the world during ten months of the year. The Balti
race deserve a high degree of esteem and goodwill. They are scrupulously honest,
mild of manners, gentle and good-tempered, naturally amenable to discipline,
capable of the hardest labour, incredibly temperate, happy with very little and
invariably good-humoured.

[^0603]: [R. STRACHEY (*On the Physical Geography of the Provinces of Kumaun and Gahrwal,* etc.,
*Jour. Roy. Geog. Soc.* 21, 1851, p. 57) has observed a difference of more than 3,000 feet in the lowest level of the snows, and one of more than 4,500 feet in the lowest limit reached by the glaciers, between the southern and northern slopes of the Himalaya of Kumaun and Gahrwal. F. DREW (op. cit.) found corresponding differences in the Western Himalaya; S. J. BURRARD (op. cit.) says that the snow line in the Punjab Himalaya is some 2,000 feet lower on the southern than on the northern side.]{.footnote}

[^0607]: [The geographical nomenclature of Baltistan is still somewhat uncertain and irregular. Not only are there many homonyms, as in the case of the Shigar, but in many places the names of rivers change with change important confluent. or even at every bend of the same valley. Furthermore, countries and places change their names without any obvious reason, which has occasionally given rise to unfair charges of inaccuracy against the map of the Trigonometrical Survey of India]{.footnote}
