IT is difficult without a certain degree of acquaintance with geography to form
a clear idea of the relative sizes of different regions of the globe. This is
especially true as regards those remote countries known to most of us through
the atlas only, in which they are rendered on a far smaller scale than the
familiar countries of our own civilization. Probably few people guess how vast
and how varied is the portion of the earth to which we assign the name Himalaya.

I suppose that to most minds this word suggests the image of a lofty mountain
range, rearing up to the sky a series of peaks covered with everlasting snow,
which overlook the torrid plains of India.

But the name Himalaya denotes no mere chain of mountains, however high and
however long we may imagine it. It denotes a complex system of ranges, of
immense table-lands, of intricate valleys and of mighty rivers, that has no
rival upon the face of the earth. Put together all the mountain ranges of
Europe, great and small, including the Caucasus, and the result is not even
comparable in size to the giant backbone of the Asiatic continent.

Most modern geographers include in the term Himalaya the whole of the
mountainous region about 500 miles wide, which forms a barrier between the
Indian peninsula and Central Asia from Afghanistan to Burma, a distance of over
1,500 miles, equivalent to that between Naples and St. Petersburg. This barrier
is formed by a series of approximately parallel ranges running mainly from
north-west to southeast, and increasing in height northward up to the giant
peaks which bound the table-land of Central Asia. Here the mighty rivers of
India spring from the feet of mountains as famed in legend as the streams whose
sources they shelter—worshipped like them, and like them objects of pilgrimages
on so vast a scale as to seem like migrations of entire peoples.

The western end of this group of ranges reaches about the same latitude as the
south coast of Sicily, while the eastern end runs down as far as the Red Sea.
Thus the valleys gradually rising towards the north-west along an oblique line
present every conceivable variety of climate, vegetation and produce. They
contain whole nations with various political organizations, tribes of diverse
races and origins: Aryans, Turanians, primitive aborigines, at every stage of
civilization, speaking an endless number of different tongues, professing every
religion of Asia—Hindu, Mohammedan, Buddhist and Animist—and exemplifying social
customs which range from polygamy to polyandry. The future undoubtedly has
historical evolutions in store for this region which cannot fail to exert an
influence upon the nations of Europe.

There will be work enough for many generations of geographers, geologists,
ethnologists and naturalists before we come to know the Himalaya in its details.
And what of the mountaineer? It scarcely seems possible that man should ever
succeed in completely exploring that forest of peaks. Thousands of them probably
reach up to 20,000 feet; hundreds of them are over 23,000 feet. In the glacier
basin explored by the Duke of the Abruzzi’s expedition there are more than
twenty-five peaks above 23,000 feet.

A great part of the Himalaya is shut in by territories which are closed to the
European. Other parts of the highest chains are at a  great distance from human
habitation, secluded in a wilderness where no assistance or supplies are to be
had. Many of the valleys are nearly desert for hundreds of miles, with sparse
and squalid villages, where a scanty population just contrives to wrest a bare
living from the arid stony waste. The topographical work of the Trigonometrical
Survey of India was carried out in the face of these obstacles. The history of
privations endured, dangers faced and difficulties daily encountered and
surmounted in solitude by the brave officers who carried out this work has never
been written. The work itself was not and could not be definitive or complete.
The vast region is only known to us in its main outlines, nor is there one
single mountain group where the mountaineer, if possessed of the knowledge
befitting an explorer, may not fill up blank spaces in the map, complete it with
fresh data and correct its approximate outline.

Colonel S. G. Burrard^[^0100]^ and H. H. Hayden^[^0101]^, the Directors of the Trigonometrical and
the Geological Surveys of India, have published in recent years a brief summary
of the geographical and geological knowledge which we now possess with regard to
the Himalaya.^[^0102]^ Here we find a list of mountains whose position and height have
been accurately fixed by triangulation. Seventy-five of them are above 24,000
feet, forty-eight are above 25,000 feet, sixteen are above 26,000 feet, five are
above 27,000 feet and three above 28,000 feet.

We are not likely to discover a higher peak than Mount Everest, but there
certainly exist in the Himalaya a great many peaks which have not yet been
measured and which are between 25,000 and 27,000 feet in height. Every exploring
party brings a new one under our notice. The expedition of the Duke of the
Abruzzi took the altitude of a mountain which reached to over 27,000 feet, in
addition to fifteen peaks, now measured for the first time, all above 23,000
feet and all included in the upper basin of the Baltoro and Godwin Austen
glaciers.^[^0103]^

The principal peaks, those of 27,000 feet and over, are not grouped together in
one range, but are dispersed along the whole system of the  Himalaya. Thus the
three highest mountains on the globe are placed one in the central, one in the
western and one in the eastern Himalaya.

A brief survey of the various ranges will give me an opportunity to enumerate
the chief mountaineering and exploring expeditions which have been undertaken in
the Himalaya, and will make clear the reasons which guided His Royal Highness
the Duke of the Abruzzi in his selection of the field for his expedition.^[^0104]^

![DARJILING AND KINCHINJUNGA.](Karakoram_005.jpg "DARJILING AND KINCHINJUNGA."){#b005}
::::

Kinchinjunga, the third highest peak on the earth (28,150 feet), rises upon the
borders between Nepaul and Sikkim, where the central and eastern Himalaya meet.
It is fairly easy to reach the glaciers, which are only about 45 miles from
Darjiling, the well-known climatic station where numerous English officers and
civilians seek health and rest from the burning plains in summer. The valleys
which slope up from Darjiling into the mountains are covered with luxuriant
forests, whose aspect is tropical even at a great height and where Alpine plants
reach dimensions undreamed of in Europe—their marvellous beauty has been
described by many a traveller. This wonderful vegetation is due to the special
climate of the region, where torrents of rain fall throughout the very months of
summer which would otherwise be suitable for mountaineering. The fine weather
begins only in October, when the intense cold and the shortness of the days
present serious obstacles to any attempt at an ascent above 23,000 feet.

![THE KABRU, SEEN FROM NEAR JONGRI, SIKKIM (ABOUT 15,000 FEET).](Karakoram_005a.jpg "THE KABRU, SEEN FROM NEAR JONGRI, SIKKIM (ABOUT 15,000 FEET)."){#b005a}
::::

Nevertheless, it was upon a peak of this chain, the Kabru, that the greatest
height on record had been reached before the Duke of the Abruzzi’s expedition.
In October, 1907, two Norwegians, C. W. Rubenson^[^0107]^ and Monrad Aas, climbed this
mountain nearly to the summit, attaining a height of almost 24,000 feet.^[^0105]^ This
exploit put an end to the long controversy among mountaineers as to the
credibility of the assertion of W. W. Graham to the effect that he had climbed
the Kabru to within a few feet of the summit in 1883.

Kinchinjunga itself was explored on all its slopes in the year 1899 by an
expedition led by D. W. Freshfield.^[^0106]^^[^0108]^

In this expedition Vittorio Sella took part and has given us photographs of the
whole of that beautiful group. Although Freshfield abstains from any absolute
declaration of the impossibility of ascending Kinchinjunga, and although he even
went so far as to plan a route by which an attempt might be made, still he does
not hazard any forecast as to the probabilities of success. As seen in Sella’s
photographs, Kinchinjunga certainly does not appear to offer any very obvious
route for an easy ascent—an essential condition to the attainment of the
greatest heights.

Thus we see that the Sikkim Himalaya does not hold out good chances for such an
ascent. Neither does it offer many opportunities of geographical discovery in
the event of unsuccess In mountaineering, should an expedition ever follow on
the track of so competent and observant an explorer as Freshfield.

Westward of Sikkim we see the Central Himalaya, between Nepaul to the south and
Tibet to the north. These states have long been forbidden country to the
European, by the desire of their own rulers as well as by the conventions and
mutual undertakings of England and Russia. This portion of the Himalaya
comprises Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world, whose altitude (29,002
feet) was calculated by triangulation in 1852. Since that date active
exploration on either side of the ranges has revealed no other mountain of equal
or greater height, and as time goes on the discovery of such a one becomes less
and less probable.

Although no topographer has been able to get within 80 miles of the Nepaul
range, nevertheless Burrard’s list gives the measurements of twenty-five peaks
above 24,000 feet, nineteen of which are above 25,000 feet, eight above 26,000
feet and two above 27,000 feet, beside Mount Everest, which is above 29,000
feet.^[^0109]^

This is indubitably the part of the Himalaya where the most important
geographical discoveries still remain to be made. So long, however, as the
political conditions remain unchanged there is no hope for the explorer in that
direction.

Further to the west, in the corner between Nepaul, Kashmir and Tibet, lies the
Himalaya of Kumaun and Gahrwal. This important group is easy of access from the
plain, and not far from good base-stations for supplies. Hence its pleasant and
well-wooded valleys are frequently sought out by travellers and mountaineers. It
is said that the name Himalaya, or Himaleh, ”abode of the snow” or “abode of
winter,”  had its origin among the snow-capped ranges of Gahrwal. Around the
twin peaks of Nanda Devi^[^0114]^, which are between 25,000 and 26,000 feet, cluster
lower peaks, upon one of which, Mount Kamet^[^0115]^, the brothers H. and R.
Schlagintweit^[^0113]^ reached a height of 22,260 feet in the year
1855.^[^0110]^ In 1883 W. W. Graham made several ascents in this group, reaching
23,185 feet on Dunagiri^[^0111]^; and in 1907 Dr. T. G. Longstaff^[^0116]^ reached the
summit of Trisul^[^0117]^, 23.406 feet.^[^0112]^

::::

To the west of Gahrwal the range assumes the name of the Punjab Himalaya, and
rises toward the centre to a dominant group of peaks known as the Nun Kun^[^0121]^, with
twin peaks of about 23,400 feet. In 1906 Dr. Hunter Workman and Mrs. Bullock
Workman^[^0120]^ made an expedition in this range, in the course of which Mrs. Workman
reached an altitude of 23,300 feet.^[^0118]^

Beyond Nun Kun the Himalaya skirts the north side of the plateau of Kashmir,
then seems suddenly to come to an end, as if in one last magnificent effort, in
the great peak of Djamirai, better known as Nanga Parbat (26,620 feet). This
superb mountain gains in grandeur by its splendid isolation, as there is no
rival in the surrounding region. It can be seen from many points in Kashmir and
in Afghanistan, and even as far off as near Peshawar; and after Kinchinjunga, at
the other extremity of the Himalaya, is probably the most familar peak in India.

The name of Nanga Parbat will always be associated with that of A. F. Mummery,^[^0122]^
one of the finest mountaineers of our day, who lost his Life on this mountain in
1895. He had reached about 20,000 feet on the north-west slope of the mountain,
and had given up all idea of attempting to continue the ascent by that route,
which proved too difficult. He was killed by an avalanche while endeavouring to
reach the northern slopes of the mountain.

All those who have seen Nanga Parbat from near speak of it as apparently almost
inaccessible, owing to the forbidding rock precipices from which hang steep and
dangerous glaciers.^[^0119]^ In the event of a failure upon Nanga Parbat there are no
other peaks of great altitude to fall back upon in the neighbourhood, nor would
important geographical discoveries reward research in that region.

The Punjab Himalaya, as we have seen, contains few peaks of great height, but to
the north of it stretches a huge system of mountains known as the Karakoram. Of
all the Himalayan regions not absolutely closed to European enterprise, this is
certainly the one that offers the greatest hope of useful work to the
geographer, the naturalist and the mountaineer.

It is separated from the Himalaya proper by the upper course of the Indus, and
lies nearly 200 miles from the capital of Kashmir. Thus it is accessible only to
expeditions organized for distant exploration, and on this account it has been
seldom visited—the greater number of the higher valleys and glaciers are to this
day unexplored.

Karakoram in Tibetan means “black gravel.” The name was noted and introduced by
W. Moorcroft, the first European explorer to cross the chain, about 1820.^[^0123]^ The
word Mustagh, or “ice mountain,“ was subsequently suggested as more appropriate.
The suggestion, however, was not adopted, because in Chinese Turkestan all snow
peaks are called Mustagh.

I will barely hint at the discussion as to whether the Karakoram should be
included, geographically speaking, in the Himalaya, or whether it should be
treated as a separate mountain system. The latter is the opinion of the
Schlagintweits, of Cunningham, of the Workmans, etc.^[^0124]^ Burrard^[^0126]^ would include in
the Karakoram system all the mountains to the north of the Indus. The Karakoram
is usually distinguished from the Hindu Kush, which is its prolongation to the
westward.^[^0125]^ In this direction the sources of the Gilgit, an affluent of the
Indus, mark the boundary between the two chains. Eastward the Karakoram range is
bounded by the sources of the Shyok, an important stream which, after a long and
winding course through the greater part of Baltistan, flows like the Gilgit into
the Indus. Between these boundaries the Karakoram chain stretches for about 450
miles.

Some of the greatest glaciers of the world are contained in the Karakoram range.
In no part of the Himalaya do we find such a number of very high peaks in so
limited a space. Burrard counts fortytwo peaks of and above 24,000 feet in the
whole of the Himalaya proper from Sikkim to Kashmir, and thirty-three in the
Karakoram system alone (twenty-nine if we do not include in this system the
peaks farther to the north). These mountains are grouped around four great
glaciers—the Chogo Lungma, the Hispar, the Biafo and the Baltoro. A fifth and
still larger glacier basin, the Siachen, was explored for the first  time by Dr.
Longstaff during the same summer in which the Duke of the Abruzzi went to the
Karakoram. The Chogo Lungma and the Hispar form the centre of the mountain
groups of Kunjut and Hunza, with seven peaks between 24,000 and 25,500 feet.
This is the part of the Karakoram which was first known and has most often been
explored since—by G. T. Vigne in 1835, by Dr. Falconer in 1841, by Dr. Thomson
in 1847-48 and by A. Schlagintweit in 1856.^[^0127]^ In 1892 Sir Martin Conway^[^0136]^ traversed
for the first time and surveyed in their entire length the Hispar and Biafo
glaciers.^[^0128]^ The Chogo Lungma basin was the field of several of the expeditions of
Dr. and Mrs. Workman, whom I have already mentioned. With remarkable
perseverance they returned to the same region in four different summers—in 1899,
1902, 1903 and 1908. In the course of these expeditions Dr. Workman reached a
height of about 23,400 feet on the ridge of a peak at the head of the Chogo
Lungma glacier.^[^0129]^

Eastward of the mountains of Hunza lies the Karakoram proper, which includes the
Baltoro glacier, and contains eight peaks between 25,110 and 28,250 feet known
before the Duke’s expedition. Along the single gigantic valley down which flow
the Baltoro and its affluents, tower a series of peaks comprising K^2^, the
second highest mountain in the world (28,250 feet); the four Gasherbrums,
between 26,000 and 26,470 feet; the two Masherbrums, over 26,500 feet; the
Bride Peak, 25,110 feet; and the three summits of the Broad Peak, whose
altitudes (27,132, 26,188 and 26,022 feet) have been ascertained for the first
time by the Duke’s expedition. I speak of the higher peaks only.

![K^2^ FROM THE SOUTH.](Karakoram_011.jpg "K^2^ FROM THE SOUTH."){#b011}
::::

The Baltoro glacier was first discovered and its lower portion explored by
Colonel Godwin Austen in the course of his topographical campaign in the
Karakoram (1860-61), which yielded such important geographical results.^[^0130]^ The
glacier was again visited in 1886 by Colonel Sir Francis Younghusband.^[^0131]^ It was
not, however, until the memorable expedition of Sir Martin Conway in 1892 that
it was traversed in its whole length and surveyed, as well as its rivals, the
Hispar and Biafo glaciers.^[^0132]^ The Baltoro glacier is divided into two branches in
its upper course. The south-eastern branch preserves the name Baltoro, and this
part alone had been explored by Sir Martin Conway. The other arm, known as the
Godwin Austen glacier, flows round the base of the south face of K^2^, and had
been visited in 1902 by an expedition led by the English mountaineer O.
Eckenstein,^[^0133]^ accompanied by two Englishmen, A. E. Crowley^[^0134]^ and G. Knowles, two
Austrians, Drs. H. Pfannl and V. Wessely, and the Swiss doctor, J. J.
Guillarmod^[^0135]^, who wrote an account of the undertaking.^[^0137]^ This was the only
expedition which had had a near view of K^2^ before the Duke of the Abruzzi. Of
all the numerous peaks which crowd along the sides of the Baltoro, two alone had
been climbed, and both by Sir Martin Conway, in 1892—Crystal Peak, 19,400 feet,
on the right-hand side of the glacier, and a minor peak of the Golden Throne
group, situated near the upper end of the Baltoro and 26,200 feet high, which
Conway named Pioneer Peak.

The basin of the Baltoro glacier appeared by all accounts to be the most suited
to a mountaineering and exploring expedition which proposed as its aim the
investigation of the problem concerning the possibility of ascending the highest
peaks. Here we have K^2^, the highest mountain at present open to Europeans to
attempt, only 750 feet lower than Mount Everest.^[^0138]^ The only expedition which had
ever had a near view of it was of opinion that there were chances of success,
and Guillarmod expressed himself as decidedly inclined to consider the ascent a
feasible one. Furthermore, K^2 is surrounded by numerous peaks ranging from
26,000 to 27,000 feet, far above the highest point yet reached upon any
mountain; and there seemed a reasonable probability that some one of these might
be fairly accessible. Last but not least, the region had been visited by but a
single expedition, and that not specially equipped for topographical work. The
greater part of the valleys and glaciers were as yet untrodden by man. Whole
mountain ranges were still indicated on the map by a few points only, and it was
permissible for the geographer to hope to fill up these gaps.

I may add a few words to explain the strange designation of the second highest
peak in the world, K^2^, for the benefit of those who are not acquainted with
the system of nomenclature of the Trigonometrical Survey of India. When the
latter began its labours in the Himalaya it was confronted with the problem of
how to designate individually the thousands of important peaks which had no
name. Few and far between are those upon which the natives living at the foot of
the ranges have felt the necessity of bestowing a name. Of the seventy-five
peaks given in Burrard’s list, only nineteen have native names. Furthermore, the
tribes on the different sides of the great chains belong to different races and
speak different languages, and have little intercourse with one another. Hence
the few names which do exist are different on the north and on the south side of
the same mountain.

Colonel Montgomerie, under whose direction the work of triangulation of the
Himalaya began, invented an ingenious scheme of nomenclature which resembles the
ancient system of designating the heavenly bodies, based upon the grouping of
them into constellations. He designated the Karakoram region by the letter K,
and each peek by the names K^1^, K^2^, K^3^, etc. The advantages of this method
as to clearness and simplicity are obvious, had it only been adopted throughout
the Himalaya. Unfortunately, other topographers proceeded to give the initial
letters of their own names to the peaks which they subsequently measured, and
hence arose great confusion owing to different observers having the same initial
letter or name.

Burrard’s view is that it is better for the present to designate the peaks
simply by their altitude; and, as a matter of fact, many of them are indicated
in this manner only. This system has been followed by the Duke in his map of the
region he explored, with regard to the peaks measured by his expedition.

The only non-indigenous name adopted by the Trigonometrical Bureau of India is
that of Everest for the highest peak, which was at first indicated as Peak XV;
but in the case of K^2^ the name Godwin Austen, proposed in 1888 by General
Walker in recognition of the merits of the great Himalayan topographer. has been
rejected. Nor is it likely that a better fate awaits any of the numerous names
which travellers have collected from among the natives of Baltistan.

[^0137]: [Dr. J. JACOT GUILLARMOD, *Six mois dans l´Himalaya.* Neuchatel, no date. Guillarmod puts K^2^ and the Baltoro basin in the Hindu Kush, though the chain usually designated by this name is situated, as we have seen, about 250 miles farther to the west. We have also two excellent shorter accounts of the expedition by PFANNL, *Von meiner Reise zum K^2^ in den Bergen Baltistans, Mitt. der Geogr. Ges. Wien,* 47, 1904, p. 247, and Zeit. d. Deut. u. Oest. Alpenvereins, 35, 1904, p. 88.]{.footnote}

[^0138]: [The designation of K^2^ as the second highest mountain in the world must not be taken too literally. As a matter of fact, it is less than a hundred feet higher than Kinchinjunga, and the calculations cannot yet be made with such exactness as to eliminate all chances of error. There is still the possibility that Kinchinjunga may prove to be the higher of the two.]{.footnote}
