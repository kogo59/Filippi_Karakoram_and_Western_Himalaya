THE Dukes plan, which he had worked out to the smallest detail, was to leave a
base camp at Rdokass, with supplies of food and other stores, and to form an
advanced base camp on the Godwin Austen glacier at the foot of K^2^. M. Baines
was left in charge of the Rdokass station, with the mportant duties of
provisioning the high camp and communicating with Askoley when needful. It was,
therefore, necessary for him to have at his disposal enough coolies to keep him
constantly in touch with the expedition. The task involved both responsibility
and sacrifice, and Mr. Baines showed great ability and punctuality in the
performance of it.

Rdokass lies on the western slope of a great spur belonging to the southern
chain of the Baltoro, about 300 feet above the glacier and some 10 miles from
its end. It is a place which lends itself wonderfully to a long stay with a
sufficient number of coolies. The camping ground was covered with dry grass from
the previous year, through which new blades were pushing their way, as well as
here and there the first tiny blue stars of the early primula. A heavy landslide
had at some past time covered the slope with gigantic blocks of granite, some of
them as big as houses, which were piled up in confusion, leaning at all possible
angles, and forming in their interstices nooks and caverns large enough to
afford shelter to hundreds of coolies.

![THE CAMP AT RDOKASS.](Karakoram_190.jpg "THE CAMP AT RDOKASS."){#b190}
::::

Our tents were set up on a narrow level space, while a similar ledge farther
down held those of the guides and the kitchen. A stream ran close by through a
little vale covered with thick underbrush which yielded us abundant fuel. It
consisted of a species of *lonicera*, which only grows six or eight feet high
and is apparently the shrub found at the greatest height in the Baltoro basin.
The grass runs up about 1,000 feet higher, and later on we found saxifrage and
potentilla in blossom at about 18,000 feet. But the woody growth apparently
stops at about 13,200 feet, though Conway and the Workmans found specimens at
from 14,500 to 15,000 feet on the slopes of the Hispar in the shape of dwarf
willows, not much more than a foot high.

The Duke had planned to stop only one day at Rdokass to make the arrangements
for supplies, etc., and then to start ahead with a small party to select the
best place for the high camp, the rest of the expedition following the next day
with the heavy baggage and supplies. About half of the coolies who came with us
to Askoley were to help carry the luggage to the upper camp; they were then to
be sent back with the exception of thirty-five—ten for the use of the expedition
on the high glaciers and twenty-five to remain under Mr. Baines’ orders at the
Rdokass base camp.

Our first task, therefore, was to select thirty-five volunteers among the
younger and stronger coolies, who should remain with us until our return to
Askoley. We had no difficulty in finding them, for they were all equally anxious
to stay. We next proceeded to equip the ten who were to be with us in the high
mountains. First, we made sure that each of them was provided with the usual
native garments in good condition—tunie, trousers, blanket and puttees. To these
we added heavy woollen socks, nailed boots, snow spectacles and sheepskin
sleeping-bags, and three tents were allotted to the party of ten. Later on we
distributed puttoo mittens, roughly made but very serviceable. The mere sight of
all this wealth filled the coolies with joy, particularly the European boots,
which were looked upon enviously by those not among the fortunate ten. The
coolies who formed the Rdokass contingent were furnished with the native
sheepskin boots known as *pabboos,* which are excellent for walking over rocks
and moraine. The Duke had had several hundred pairs of these made, for they do
not last long in the wear and tear of moraine work. We carried also a supply of
skins, awls and cobbler’s thread to mend them with.

Meantime the coolies had built little fires along the stream, and were busily
preparing and baking a supply of chupattis large enough to last for the next few
days. The meal is coarse and grey. It is simply kneaded with water without
leaven, and shaped into flat cakes. Some of these, intended for immediate
consumption, were baked by wrapping them around a red-hot pebble and then
rolling the pebble over a slab of hot stone. The rest, which were to be carried
as supplies, were baked on high iron plates. The daily ration of a Balti is one
seer (about two lbs.) of coarse meal, counting a good deal of bran, and a little
salt, nothing more. Now and again as a special reward a little tea, sugar or
tobacco was served out to them. I know of no other human race capable of an
equal amount of work in such a severe climate, upon nourishment so poor in
quality and meagre in quantity.

We next paid off and sent back the 200 coolies who were no longer needed. Each
of them was entitled to 2½ rupees, beside two seers of meal for the return
journey: and they were told that the meal would be served out to them as soon as
they had been paid. But finding themselves in possession of so vast a sum they
were so eager to get home that they all rushed off joyously without stopping for
the meal before we were aware of their going, busy as we were in paying out the
wages. The result was that the 800 lbs. of meal went to swell our stock.

![COOKING CHUPATTIS.](Karakoram_192.jpg "COOKING CHUPATTIS."){#b192}
::::

We still had more than 150 coolies to carry our equipment and supplies to the
foot of K^2^. The baggage was first gathered together: the Alpine equipment,
consisting of extra ice-axes, a large supply of mountaineering rope, crampons,
snow-shoes and iron spikes for the rocks; the topographical
instruments—photogrammetric camera and plates, and compasses: the meteorological
instruments—mercury barometers, aneroids, hypsometer and thermometers; lastly,
Sella’s photographic equipment, except the cinematograph, which was left behind
at Rdokass. We also left our camp-beds, and from now on spread our sleeping-bags
on the floor of the tent. Few people know that it is warmer to lie directly on
the waterproof bottom of the tent, even when it is set up on snow or ice, than
on a camp bedstead which leaves a perpetually chilly void between you and the
ground. Our sleeping-bags, which had been specially planned by the Duke, were
admirably fitted for a journey on which every variety of climate was to be
encountered. They consisted of four bags, which could be used separately or one
inside the other. One was of light soft camel’s hair, one of eiderdown, one of
thick goatskin with a woollen covering, and one of waterproof canvas, to be put
outside the other three.

Our cooking apparatus was aluminium, and we used Primus paraffin stoves.^[^1101]^ The
food and stores were soldered up in tins, each one weighing about 46 lbs. and
containing all the necessaries of life for a single day.^[^1102]^ A light wooden case
protected these tins from blows, and the coolies carried them with such care
that they all reached Rdokass intact.

We carried to the high camp the same tropical tents we had used up till now, of
green Edgington canvas, small size. The Duke had also provided two Whymper tents
and two extra light Mummery tents for the camps in the high glacial basins and
on the slopes of the mountains. Our stores were completed by a box of medical
and surgical necessaries and two big tarpaulins to protect our supplies from the
weather.

We levelled the ground under a projecting rock and arranged in systematic order
all the supplies that were to be left at Rdokass. Around the whole the coolies
built a wall. They worked quickly and ingeniously, forming a chain between the
rock and the nearest point where suitable stones were to be had, and passing
material from hand to hand, so that there was no pause in the building
operations, and the wall was soon finished.

Lastly, the Duke set up a meteorological station in the shelter of a rock
flanked by a wall on either side, and supplied it with a mercury barometer,
thermometer and psichrometer. Readings were taken by Mr. Baines three times a
day from May 29th to July 15th, and at the same hours observations were made at
Leh, Skardu, Gilgit and Srinagar. The calculations based on these data give
Rdokass an altitnde of 13,205 feet.^[^1103]^ It thus became a station of reference for
the calculation of the Duke's observations in the high mountains during this
period.

![PAIJU PEAK AND THE LOWER BALTORO FROM RDOKASS.](Karakoram_194.jpg "PAIJU PEAK AND THE LOWER BALTORO FROM RDOKASS."){#b194}
::::

We had now reached more than 13,000 feet above sea level, without experiencing
any symptom of suffering from altitude. We all slept soundly, and our appetites
were excellent. Some of us, however, noted even at this early period that when
we stooped down to tie our shoes or wind our puttees, for instance, we would be
caught by a slight sense of oppression on standing up again, and obliged to take
four or five deep breaths. It is, of course, impossible to walk uphill as fast
as in the lower regions without some shortness of breath, but I can hardly count
this as a symptom of mountain sickness.

The grassy slope of Rdokass ends some 300 feet above the camping place with a
little level terrace, from which springs the real wall of the valley, all of
rock still covered with ice and snow. This terrace gives a fine outlook over the
whole lower course of the Baltoro which we have just traversed. But, like the
camp, it lies on the western side of the spur behind a big ridge, which cuts off
the view of the upper Baltoro. To obtain a sight of the whole marvellous valley
in its incomparable grandeur you must clime much higher behind Rdokass, to the
corniced ridge of snow which terminates the wall about 3,000 feet above the
glacier. It was from this point, on our return, that Sella made [panorama B](https://flic.kr/p/2nivsAp),
which shows 25 miles of the Baltoro glacier, from the foot of the Gasherbrum
down to a point quite close to the snout.

:::: { .wrap-100 }
![Lower End of the Baltoro Glacier.](Karakoram_195.jpg "Lower End of the Baltoro Glacier."){#b195}
::::

The Baltoro is the fifth of the great glaciers of the world outside the Arctic
regions. The distance from its snout to the foot of Hidden Peak is 36 miles. The
Siachen (or Saichar) glacier is 45 miles long (Longstaff), the Inylehek (of the
Tian Shan range, north of the Karakoram) is 44 miles (Merzbacher), and the
Biafo it nearly 37 miles (Workman). The Hispar is about the same length as the
Baltoro—just above 36 miles (Workman). No other known glacier reaches 30 miles,
In fact, the largest glacier of the Himalaya proper—the Zemu, of the
Kinchinjunga group—is only 16 miles long (Freshfield); but the Nepaul Himalaya
and the Everest group may have surprises in store.

The Baltoro ascends as far as the foot of the Gasherbrum in an almost straight
line, with an even regular slope from 11,000 to 15,700 feet, giving a grade of
barely 31 per cent., and a uniform width of about two miles, which makes it look
from a distance like an immense highroad. Godwin Austen wrote that it s as if a
great glacier filled up the Val d’Aosta from Mont Blanc to Chatillon, or flowed
down from the Simplon to Lago Maggiore through the Valle del Toce. But even if
we could imagine such a sight, it would not much resemble the Baltoro. No Alpine
valley has the elements of anything even remotely similar to this vast roadway
of ice between its precipitous walls. It is beyond all comparison; it differs
from all Alpine scenery not merely in the scale, but in the actual form and
features.

Our attention was drawn from the Baltoro to fix itself upon the wild rampart to
the north, dominated by a forest of unnumbered peaks that are between 20,000 and
23,000 feet high and show a fantastic variety of form and structure. Not until
the clouds descended and lay motionless over the high peaks did we return to the
observation of the valley and its tributaries.

The Baltoro seen from above is chiefly of a uniform grey colour, due to the
detritus which covers it. Only higher up do the moraines become separated and
distinct. The centre is marked, however, by a tall moraine ridge running
lengthwise and slightly sinuous, which lends the semblance of organic structure
to the glacier, making it look like some monstrous vertebrate crouching at the
bottom of the valley, whose outline it follows with its full and rounded flanks.
Here and there pale streaks of limestone in the moraine, or a gleam of ice like
the glint upon shining scales, completes the imaginary likeness to a dragon of
fable. Unlike the Hispar and the Biafo, which are shrunk within the walls of
their valleys, not even extending to their own ancient marginal moraines, the
Baltoro fills its bed completely, as may be seen from panorama B. But what gives
it its most characteristic feature and makes it absolutely unlike our own
valleys is the appearance of the side spurs, which do not slope down to the
valley with ridges and diminishing buttresses, but come to an end suddenly, as
if they had been cut off, with wide and high perpendicular walls. Between these
spurs open at regular intervals tributary valleys five or six miles long, also
deeply set between vertical walls and forming almost a right angle with the main
valley, like streets opening between blocks of buildings on either side of the
main thoroughfare of a city. The glaciers of all these tributary valleys flow
out on top of the Baltoro with a high front and without any trace of terminal
moraine. They certainly give the impression of being in a state of active
growth.

Conway gathered names from the natives for most of these tributary glaciers.
Guillarmod made further inquiry, and changed the names about from one glacier to
another, adding new ones. Ferber kept these names for the glaciers, but added
others for the valleys down which they run. The Workmans, too, rearranged or
changed the names given by Conway to the confluents of the Hispar glacier.
Probably every voyager to these regions at intervals of a few years could
collect data for further changes. It is evidently not alone in the inhabited
portions of Baltistan that the names of valleys and rivers change. It is to the
interest of the geographer to establish a fixed nomenclature—he cannot be
expected to conform with capricious changes. The Duke has adopted in his map the
nomenclature of Guillarmod, as being simpler than that of Ferber. The following
comparative table shows the names given by different travellers to the same
places, and at the same time gives a list of the confluents of the Baltoro in
their order from the snout to the Concordia basin. The northern tributaries are
all shown in panorama B except the lowest, the Ull Biaho of Guillarmod.

::::

Rdokass stands opposite the Biale, the fourth confluent on the right bank, a
secondary glacier filling a steep gorge carved out on the face of a spur (see
panorama B). A little beyond is the mouth of an important valley filled by the
Mustagh glacier, which runs deep up into the chain to the ancient pass of the
same name, 19,000 feet high, over which Askoley used to communicate with
Yarkand. The pass seems to have been in use in early times—Ujfalvy states that
the Portuguese Jesuit, D’Espinaha, erossed it in 1760. According to Vigne, it
was still open under Ahmed Shah, the last independent Rajah of Skardu in the
first half of the last century. But when Godwin Austen went to Askoley and the
Baltoro in 1861 it was said to have become impracticable, owing to great
accumulations of snow and ice.

![MUSTAGH TOWER AND PASS FROM ABOVE RDOKASS.](Karakoram_198.jpg "MUSTAGH TOWER AND PASS FROM ABOVE RDOKASS."){#b198}
::::

We owe our first detailed account of the route across the pass to Colonel Sir
Francis Younghusband, who traversed it at the end of 1887.^[^1104]^ He was on his way
from Kashgar, which he had reached after crossing the whole of China; and he
started over the Karakoram with a few coolies, no tent, a single sleeping-bag. a
fur coat apiece, and a scanty supply of dried provisions. He ascended to the top
of the pass by the gentle slope of the Sarpo Laggo glacier, which was deep in
soft snow, and descended on the Baltoro side by a steep and broken ice wall, a
proceeding both difficult and dangerous for a party lacking the simplest
mountaineering equipment. The condition of the glaciers more than justified the
abandonment of this pass. A, C. F. Ferber climbed up to the Mustagh col with E.
Honigmann in September, 1903, and collected some interesting indications of
active coming and going across it in the past.^[^1105]^ Upon a grassy slope near the
Mustagh glacier he found a village of twenty-two huts, abandoned and in ruins,
one of which contained a tomb. There were clear traces of camping grounds, and
even an artificially levelled spot called Sharagan. 800 feet long by 160 feet
wide, which had once been used for polo matches, presumably on foot, between the
Baltis and Yarkandis.^[^1106]^ Ferber also brought back from his expedition a
topographical sketch of the Mustagh glacier and pass, whose position had
heretofore been only vaguely noted on the map.

On the day following our arrival at Rdokass, after a brilliant morning, the sky
clouded over little by little—at first with only a thin veil; then sleet began
to fall, growing thicker and thicker, until it settled down into a heavy
snowfall. The aspect of the glacier changed utterly. The tall central moraine
ridge, with its notched crest, remained quite black, owing to radiation from the
thick strata of detritus; but on both sides the glacier grew white as far as the
marginal moraines, where again the snow melted as it fell. A clear distinction
was thus drawn between principal and secondary moraines.

It was useless to think of starting on May 21st. with fresh snow lying a
hand’s-breadth deep on the Baltoro. Even had it been possible to reduce the
coolies to move, we could not have gone far over ground so treacherous. even
when uncovered, that you risk a fall with every step. The snow continued to
fall, but no longer so heavily, and later on the sun showed for a few hours,
feeble and veiled but sufficiently powerful to melt most of the fresh snow.

During the day Botta was taken with chills and fever. It was a passing illness,
and gave way to salicylic treatment within twenty-four hours. The sheep and
goats were now straggling into camp, worn out with being driven for three days
without food. They greedily began to nibble the dry grass that stuck out here
and there through the snow. During the day we finished all our arrangements for
the base camp.

::::

The coolies enjoyed the unexpected rest, huddled in their dens as thick as
rabbits in a warren. They swarmed in every chink and hollow among the rocks. We
discovered that they made as many separate little camps as there were villages
from which they came, but evidently not owing to any hostility between these
communities, for them relations were unbroken and seemed very cordial. The
variety of anthropological types is striking. By far the greater number are
dark, but a few are blond, occasionally even red-haired. Some are absolutely
smooth-faced, others have thick beards. One would say that the Italic types
prevailed—characteristic Lombard heads, the full and somewhat heavy features of
certain portrait busts of Roman antiquity, and most marked of all, the type, by
no means uncommon, of the Florentine page of the trecento, with a face that
agrees very well with the fringe of long hair hanging all round the head. One
sees sometimes a group positively biblical in appearance—figures draped in white
blankets, with the head swathed n a narrow piece of the same stuff, the ends
hanging down the back, and faces of a Semitic east. Again, one notices a plainly
Mongol type, with the characteristic oblique eyes and prominent cheekbones. Many
of them while busy baking the chupattis took off nearly all their clothes, with
complete indifference to the snow which fell on their backs. They almost always
go about barefoot.

![Sunset from the Rocks above Rdokass.](Karakoram_201.jpg "Sunset from the Rocks above Rdokass."){#b201}
::::

Rdokass has abundant animal life, notwithstanding its altitude of over 13,000
feet and its situation among the glaciers. Small rodents about the size of
guinea-pigs, with long light grey hair and round erect ears, start up in every
direction and hide away under the stones.^[^1107]^ Small birds hop about the tents, and
flights of ash-grey pigeons with black heads pass above us. Not far from the
camp flocks of some bird of the genus passer chirp about on the turf. They are
the size of blackbirds, grey and dark green in colour with a black throat. From
the near-by bushes we hear the call of the giant partridge or ram chikor, and
every level spot on the mountain side is full of the prints of ibexes. The
arrival of so large a party and the smell of smoke had frightened them all off
to a distance. Along the margins of the glacier nearly up to the Concordia we
found remains of ibexes which had fallen victim to avalanches or to the snow
leopard.^[^1108]^

The brief interval of sunshine proved a deceiving prophecy. The snow came on
again in the night, so heavily that by the morning of May 22nd the whole scene
had become absolutely wintry, and the Duke was obliged to give up another day.
It did not turn out to be altogether lost time, for Sella, with the guides and a
few coolies, went down to the Baltoro and crossed it to the central moraine
ridge, where they set up a large stone pyramid. Meantime Negrotto with his
graduated staff and tacheometer had measured out along the slope an accurate
base line of about 300 feet, from either end of which he took the angles to the
apex of the pyramid. When we got back to Rdokass on July 23rd he repeated these
observations. The pyramid had somewhat gone to pieces, hut was still easily
recognizable, and from his data Negrotto ascertained that it had moved 361 feet
down the glacier during he interval of sixtyv-two days. This gives a notable
average daily speed of nearly 5 feet 10 inches for the central stream of the
Baltoro 10 miles from its snout, If this rate were kept up, it would result in a
progress of 2,124 feet a year; but in reality it must be less, for we know that
the current is slower in winter than in summer. Observations on the speed of the
current in Himalayan glaciers have been very scanty up to the present. R.
Strachey gives some measurements taken in the Kumaun-Gahrwal group, where the
glaciers are nearer those of our own Alps in size. They move much more slowly
than the Baltoro. At the centre of the glacier which forms the source of the
Pindi—a confluent of the Ganges—an average advance of 9½ inches in twenty-four
hours was observed in May, and from May 21st to October 15th the same glacier
moved 98.57 feet, giving an average of 8 inches a day.^[^1109]^ It flows down to 11,900
feet. Another glacier, the Gori, which flows down to 11,500 feet. covered 37.92
feet between August 2nd and September 30th, an average of 141 inches a day. Mr.
Hewett, an English topographer who was with the Workmans on the Chogo Lungma,
took various measurements of the rate of the latter at two points 15 and 18
miles from the snout, by observing various points of the surface at different
distances from the two stations. His results varied considerably for the
different points. However, the highest speeds which he observed—namely, 3.08,
3.16 and 3.29 feet in twenty-four hours may—be compared with Negrotto’s results
on the Baltoro, taking into account the difference in volume between the two
glaciers. On the other hand, on the Hoh Lumba, a much smaller glacier, which
runs down to the north of the Braldoh valley, the Workmans found a mean velocity
of about .26 feet in twenty-four hours, at a point where the inclination is
barely 2° 32´. It looks as though the giant glaciers of the Karakoram flowed at
a much higher speed than the ordinary Alpine glacier, and, of course, it would
be reasonable to expect that, other conditions being equal, a certain relation
should exist between mass and velocity.^[^1110]^ Let us hope that these observations may
soon be taken on the other great glaciers of the region.

Toward evening the weather showed symptoms of clearing, and the Duke had
everything prepared for a start on the following morning—not in two parties
according to the original plan, but all together. Mr. Baines, who was anxious to
get a glimpse of K^2^ before shutting himself up in his Rdokass hermitage,
accompanied us as far as the meeting of the Baltoro with the Godwin Austen,
whence he returned to the base camp with the coolies.
