Once more I entrust to Cav. Filippo De Filippi, my travelling companion, the
complete account of my late expedition. I am grateful to him for undertaking the
task, and I hope that his received memories of our journey may have rendered his
labour less burdensome.

The detailed history of our wanderings will explain better than I was able to do
in my short lectures before the Italian Alpine Club and the Italian Geographical
Society, the difficulties and obstacles which the expedition encountered. The
map of the Baltoro glacier^[^0000]^ which accompanies this volume was planned and
encountered at the Military Geographical Institute of Florence from
photogrammetric panoramas assisted by tacheometer observations taken during the
campaign by Shipâ€™s Lieutenant Marchese Federico Negrotto Combiuso. I am glad of
this opportunity to express my warm thanks to Ing. Comm. Pio Paganini, the
inventor of the photogrammetric method, who has been at all tones most generous
with aid and advice; to Major-General Ernesto Gliamas. Director of the Military
Geographical Institute of Florence; to Lieut.-Colonel Prospero Baglione; to
Captain Nicola Vacchelli; to the topographers Fortunato Senno and Giuseppe
Galli; and to all others who co-operated in the construction of the map.

Professor Domenico Omodet has once more taken upon himself the wearisome task of
calculating and collating the statistics gathered from my meteorological
observations, thus increasing the debt of gratitude already incurred by me for
his help in former expeditions.

I am likewise most grateful to Ing. Vittorio Novarese, of the Regio Ufficio
Geologico, for the geological survey he has written, based upon the observations
made by the expedition; and to Professor Romualdo Pirotta and to Dr. Fabrizio
Cortesi for their botanical notes upon the plants collected by Dr. De Filippi.

I hope that this book, together with the beautiful photographs taken by Cav.
Uff. Vittorio Sella, will succeed in conveying to the reader some portion of the
profound impression made upon us by our months of sojourn in the Karakoram. Our
work will not have been in vain if at prove to be of assistance to future
explorers of that distant and majestic region.
